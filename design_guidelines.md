# Siraat Design Guidelines

## Visual Identity & Brand

### Aesthetic Foundation
- **Design Inspiration**: Yemeni masjid geometry and Islamic manuscript tones
- **Mood**: Stillness after Isha prayer, not Silicon Valley productivity
- **Purpose**: Visual calm lowers cognitive load and increases reflection quality

### Color Palette
**Earth tones only:**
- Sand
- Clay  
- Deep indigo
- Muted emerald
- Charcoal

**Color Rules:**
- Soft gradients only
- NO neon colors
- NO clinical white
- Warm lighting feel throughout

### Pattern & Texture
- Arabic geometric patterns used subtly in dividers or background texture
- Never dominant, always supportive of content

### Typography
- **Headings**: Serif typeface (calm and grounded)
- **Body**: Clean sans serif
- Prioritize readability and contemplative feel

### Motion & Animation
- Minimal and intentional only
- Slow fades
- NO flashy animations
- Every motion should support reflection, not distraction

## Navigation & Architecture

### Information Architecture
**Single linear flow - NO branching**

1. Thought Capture
2. Distortion Identification  
3. Islamic Cognitive Reframe
4. Regulation Practice
5. Intention Reset

Total session time: Under 5 minutes

### Screen Structure
**Single page application**
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Clean, readable layout
- Progressive disclosure as user moves through flow

## Content & Interaction Design

### Core User Flow Screens

**1. Thought Capture**
- Text input asking user to write what is troubling their mind right now
- Generous, calm input area
- Non-judgmental framing

**2. Distortion Identification**
- Display identified cognitive distortion(s)
- Use Islamic-aligned language:
  - Despair of mercy
  - Over-attachment to dunya outcome
  - Mind reading
  - Catastrophizing
  - Emotional reasoning

**3. Islamic Cognitive Reframe**
- Present one concise reframe that:
  - Corrects the belief error
  - Grounds in Quran or authentic hadith meaning (no long quotations)
  - Validates emotions without affirming distortion
- Clear, readable typography
- Generous spacing for absorption

**4. Regulation Practice**
- Provide one practice under 2 minutes:
  - Slow breathing with dhikr count
  - Grounded remembrance
  - Gratitude recall
- Simple, guided instructions
- Calms nervous system so reframe can land

**5. Intention Reset**
- Prompt user to set one simple niyyah (intention) aligned with reframe
- Text input for personal intention
- Session ends after intention is set

### Tone & Communication Principles

**Never:**
- Shame the user
- Preach
- Invalidate emotions
- Use fatalistic language
- Use self-blame language

**Always:**
- Separate feeling from truth claim
- Anchor reframes in Islamic worldview
- Offer behavioral micro-step or intention
- Validate emotions while correcting distortions
- Emphasize effort, trust, and return to Allah

### Theological Boundaries
- Use Quran and authentic hadith concepts only
- No speculative metaphysics
- No claims of healing or guarantees
- Islam is the cognitive framework, CBT is the method

## Accessibility & Usability

### Cognitive Load
- Minimal interface elements
- One clear action per screen
- Generous white space (warm-toned, not clinical white)
- Focus user attention on reflection, not navigation

### Responsive Design
- Mobile-first approach
- Touch-friendly interaction areas
- Readable text sizes across devices
- Maintain calm aesthetic on all screen sizes

## Design System Components

### Layout
- Clean, centered content flow
- Warm background tones
- Subtle geometric accents as dividers
- Generous padding and margins

### Interactive Elements
- Minimal, intention-focused buttons
- Soft, calm state transitions
- No aggressive call-to-actions
- Progress indication that feels supportive, not rushed

### Feedback
- Gentle confirmations
- Slow, purposeful transitions between flow stages
- No jarring alerts or notifications
- Affirmative, grounded micro-copy

## Key Constraints

- **Scope**: Foundation, not finished cathedral - ready for rapid iteration
- **Session Length**: Complete flow under 5 minutes
- **Complexity**: NO branching, maintain single linear flow
- **Purpose**: This is NOT a motivational app, NOT a reminder app, NOT Western CBT with Islamic quotes added
