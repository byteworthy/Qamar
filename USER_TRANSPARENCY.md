## What Noor CBT Is

Noor CBT is an **AI-assisted Islamic CBT companion** that helps you work through difficult thoughts and emotions using cognitive behavioral therapy principles, grounded in Islamic values.

### What This Means

- **AI-Assisted:** Your conversations are with an AI, not a human therapist
- **Islamic CBT:** We combine evidence-based CBT with Islamic concepts (sabr, tawakkul, etc.)
- **Companion:** We're here to support your process, not replace professional help
- **Privacy-First:** Your reflections are private and encrypted

## What the AI Is and Is Not

### ✓ The AI IS:

1. **A Reflective Tool**
   - Helps you examine thoughts
   - Offers Islamic-rooted perspectives
   - Guides you through CBT exercises
   - Supports emotional processing

2. **Bounded by Safety Rules**
   - Governed by our AI and Islamic Safety Charter

   - Required to provide crisis resources when needed

3. **Transparent About Limitations**
   - Cannot diagnose mental health conditions
   - Cannot issue religious rulings (fatwas)
   - Cannot guarantee outcomes
   - Cannot replace human support

### ✗ The AI IS NOT:

   - No therapeutic relationship

2. **A Scholar**
   - No fatwas
   - No definitive Islamic rulings

3. **A Crisis Counselor**
   - For emergencies: 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline

4. **Infallible**

## When the AI Intervenes

The AI is programmed to intervene automatically in specific situations. Here's when and why:

### Crisis Detection

**When:** AI detects emergency-level crisis language (self-harm, suicide ideation)

**What Happens:**
1. Normal CBT flow stops immediately
2. Crisis resources provided (988, local resources)
3. Gentle care language used
4. Session logged for safety review
5. NO continuation of exercises until safety confirmed

**Why:** Your immediate safety is the top priority. The AI is not equipped to handle crisis situations alone.

### Scrupulosity Detection

**When:** AI detects religious OCD patterns (waswasa)

**What Happens:**
1. Content of obsession is NOT engaged
2. Pattern is gently named
3. Redirection to structure, not reassurance
4. Professional help recommended

**Why:** Engaging with the content of scrupulosity obsessions can worsen them. We redirect instead.

### High Distress Pacing

**When:** Emotional distress level is very high

**What Happens:**
1. Responses become shorter and simpler
2. Permission asked before any reframing
3. Soft exit offered
4. Islamic content minimized

**Why:** In high distress, complexity is harmful. Simplicity and presence are needed.

### Theological Safety Violations

**When:** AI generates content that violates Islamic safety rules

**What Happens:**
1. Output is rejected before you see it
2. Regeneration with stricter guidelines
3. If critical violation: fallback safe response used
4. Violation logged for review

**Why:** We protect you from theological harm, false promises, and spiritual bypassing.

## When Human Help is Recommended

The AI will explicitly recommend human support when:

1. **Crisis or Emergency**
   - Suicidal thoughts
   - Self-harm urges
   - Immediate danger

2. **Clinical Needs**
   - Symptoms suggest clinical condition
   - Pattern indicates need for diagnosis
   - Ongoing severe impairment

3. **Complex Situations**
   - Abuse or trauma
   - Substance issues
   - Psychosis symptoms
   - Eating disorder patterns

4. **AI Limitations**
   - Problem beyond AI scope
   - Repeated patterns without progress
   - User explicitly asks for referral

### How to Find Help

**In Crisis:**
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text)
- Crisis Text Line: Text HOME to 741741

**For Therapy:**
- Psychology Today (Find a Therapist directory)
