## Review Notes for App Store Connect (UPDATED)

**Noor Overview:**
Islamic reflection and personal growth app for everyday Muslims navigating life challenges.

**IMPORTANT POSITIONING:**
Noor is NOT a mental health therapy app or clinical tool. We provide structured reflection and personal growth tools grounded in Islamic values—NOT treatment or clinical intervention.

**Core Features:**
1. Structured Reflection Journal (examine thoughts with Islamic guidance)
2. Quran Wisdom & Authentic Hadith (daily spiritual content)
3. Islamic Calming Practices (dhikr, breathing, mindfulness)
4. Growth Insights (Premium - journey tracking)

**Islamic Authenticity:**
- Quran: Verified translations from authentic sources
- Hadith: Sahih Bukhari, Sahih Muslim collections only
- Content reviewed for Islamic accuracy

**Privacy & Security:**
- Encrypted via iOS Keychain / Android Keystore
- Biometric authentication (Face ID/Touch ID/Fingerprint)
- No third-party tracking or ads
- User-controlled data deletion

**AI Usage (Transparent):**
- Provider: Anthropic Claude API
- Purpose: Generate Islamic perspective on user's thoughts (reframing tool)
- Privacy: User thoughts sent only for API response, not stored by Anthropic
- Fallback: App works fully without AI (journaling remains functional)
- Disclosure: AI usage explained in Settings → About

**Safety Features:**
- Detects when users express serious concerns

## Common Rejection Responses (UPDATED)

**"This appears to be a mental health app"**
Response: "Noor is a lifestyle and personal growth app, not mental health treatment. We've categorized as Lifestyle (not Health & Fitness), rated 12+ (not 17+), and do not claim to treat any medical conditions. Our disclaimers clearly state we're NOT therapy."

**"Demo account doesn't work"**
Response: "Credentials verified working. Please tap 'Get Started' (not Sign Up). Email: reviewer@noor-app.com. If issue persists, please share error message."

**"Age rating should be 17+ due to health content"**
Response: "Noor does not contain medical/treatment information. We provide personal growth reflection tools grounded in Islamic values—not clinical health content. Age rating 12+ is appropriate for our target audience of teens and adults seeking Islamic personal development."

**"Privacy concerns"**
Response: "Full privacy policy at noor-app.com/privacy. No third-party data sharing. All reflections encrypted via iOS Keychain/Android Keystore. Users can delete data anytime via Settings → Delete Account or email support@noor-app.com."

**"AI content concerns"**
Response: "AI usage is transparent: Claude API generates Islamic perspectives on user reflections. Optional feature. User thoughts sent for real-time API processing only, not stored by Anthropic. Disclosure in Settings → About. App works fully without AI."

## Expedited Review Request Template (if needed for Ramadan)

**Justification:**
"Noor serves the Muslim community with Islamic reflection and personal growth tools. [Month] is Ramadan, the holiest month for Muslims, and our app provides daily Quran wisdom and spiritual reflection features particularly valuable during this period. Thoroughly tested build ready for review."
