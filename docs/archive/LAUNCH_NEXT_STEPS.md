## 🎯 Critical Path to Launch

### Step 1: Deploy Legal Documents (5 minutes) ⚡

**What**: Host Privacy Policy and Terms of Service on GitHub Pages

**Why**: Required by App Store Connect and Google Play Console

**How**:

1. Go to your GitHub repository: https://github.com/byteworthy/Noor/settings/pages
2. Under "Build and deployment":
   - Source: **Deploy from a branch**
   - Branch: **main**
   - Folder: **/docs**
3. Click **Save**
4. Wait 2-3 minutes for deployment
5. Verify URLs work:
   - Privacy: https://byteworthy.github.io/Noor/legal/privacy.html
   - Terms: https://byteworthy.github.io/Noor/legal/terms.html

**Detailed Guide**: [docs/DEPLOY_GITHUB_PAGES.md](docs/DEPLOY_GITHUB_PAGES.md)

**Status**: ⬜ Not started

---

### Step 2: Backend Deployment (1 week) 🖥️

**What**: Deploy backend API server to Railway.app or Render.com

**Why**: App cannot function without live backend (all AI processing happens server-side)

**Recommended Host**: Railway.app
**Cost**: ~$15-30/month

**Quick Start Steps**:

1. **Create Railway account** (5 min)
   - Go to https://railway.app
   - Sign up with GitHub
   - Add payment method

2. **Create new project** (2 min)
   - Click "New Project"
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Connect Noor-CBT repository

3. **Add PostgreSQL database** (1 min)
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "PostgreSQL"
   - Railway auto-provisions database
   - Copy DATABASE_URL from variables tab

4. **Set environment variables** (10 min)
   - Go to project → Variables
   - Add these required variables:
     ```
     NODE_ENV=production
     DATABASE_URL=<auto-generated-by-railway>
     PORT=5000
     ENCRYPTION_KEY=<generate-with-command-below>
     SESSION_SECRET=<generate-with-command-below>
     DATA_RETENTION_DRY_RUN=false
     ```
   - Generate secrets:
     ```bash
     # Run these locally to generate secure random strings
     node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(32).toString('hex'))"
     ```

5. **Optional: Add OpenAI API key** (later)
   - Skip for now (AI features will be disabled)
   - Add later: `AI_INTEGRATIONS_OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`

6. **Deploy** (5 min)
   - Railway auto-deploys from main branch
   - Wait for build to complete
   - Check deployment logs for errors

7. **Run database migrations** (2 min)
   - Open Railway shell (project → Shell tab)
   - Run: `npm run db:push`
   - Verify tables created: `\dt` in psql

8. **Verify deployment** (2 min)
   - Visit: `https://your-project-name.up.railway.app`
   - Should see: "Cannot GET /" (expected - no root route)
   - Check logs for startup errors

9. **Optional: Add custom domain** (10 min)
   - Purchase domain (e.g., api.noorapp.com)
   - Add domain in Railway settings
   - Configure DNS records
   - Enable managed SSL

**Detailed Guides**:
- [docs/BACKEND_HOSTING_PLAN.md](docs/BACKEND_HOSTING_PLAN.md) - Full hosting strategy
- [docs/SECRETS_AND_CONFIG.md](docs/SECRETS_AND_CONFIG.md) - Environment variables reference
- [docs/DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md](docs/DEPLOY_RUNBOOK.md) - Step-by-step deployment

### Step 3: Mobile App Testing (3-5 hours) 📱

**What**: Test app with live backend on iOS and Android

**Why**: Verify everything works end-to-end before app store submission

**How**:

1. **Update app to use production backend**:
   ```bash
   # In eas.json, update production environment:
   "production": {
     "env": {
       "EXPO_PUBLIC_DOMAIN": "your-project.up.railway.app"
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Build development client**:
   ```bash
   # iOS
   eas build --profile development --platform ios

   # Android
   eas build --profile development --platform android
   ```

3. **Run test plan**:
   - Follow [docs/MOBILE_TESTING_PLAN.md](docs/MOBILE_TESTING_PLAN.md)
   - Focus on 8 critical test suites
   - Document any bugs found

4. **Fix critical bugs** (if any)

**Detailed Guide**: [docs/MOBILE_TESTING_PLAN.md](docs/MOBILE_TESTING_PLAN.md)

**Status**: ⬜ Not started (blocked by backend deployment)

## ❓ Common Questions

**Q: Do I need a domain name?**
A: No! Railway gives you a free subdomain (e.g., `noor-api.up.railway.app`). You can add a custom domain later.

**Q: Do I need to hire an attorney for legal docs?**
A: No! Your Privacy Policy and Terms of Service are ready to go. They're production-ready for beta launch.

**Q: Do I need scholar validation before launch?**
A: No! Scholar review is optional for quality assurance. It's NOT required by app stores.

**Q: What if I don't have an OpenAI API key yet?**
A: You can deploy without it! AI features will be disabled, but you can add it later when ready to pay for usage.

**Q: How do I know if my backend is working?**
A: Visit your Railway URL in a browser. You should see "Cannot GET /" - that's correct! The API only responds to POST requests at /api/* endpoints.

**Q: What if I find bugs during testing?**
A: Fix critical bugs (crashes, data loss) before launch. Document medium/low bugs and fix post-launch.
