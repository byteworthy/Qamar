**Status:** ✅ READY FOR APP STORE CONNECT
**App:** Noor - Islamic Reflection & Personal Growth

---

## Strategic Positioning

**Previous:** Mental health therapy app

---

## App Title (30 chars max)

```
Noor: Islamic Reflection
```

**Character Count:** 26/30 ✅

**Why This Works:**
- "Noor" (Arabic for "light") - recognizable Islamic brand name
- "Islamic" - primary keyword, clear category positioning
- "Reflection" - describes core activity (journaling + thought examination)
- Avoids therapy/mental health language
- Memorable and searchable

**Alternative Options (if testing):**
- `Noor: Islamic Growth` (21/30) - emphasizes development
- `Noor: Muslim Life Guidance` (27/30) - emphasizes advice aspect

---

## Subtitle (30 chars max)

```
Islamic Growth & Guidance
```

**Character Count:** 27/30 ✅

**Why This Works:**
- "Growth" - personal development framing (not clinical)
- "Guidance" - Quran-based wisdom and advice
- Positions as lifestyle/education app
- Searchable keywords (Islamic growth, Islamic guidance)

**Alternative Options (if testing):**
- `Structured Islamic Reflection` (30/30) - unique positioning
- `Quran-Based Personal Growth` (28/30) - feature-specific

---

## Promotional Text (170 chars max, editable without app update)

```
Navigate life's challenges with Islamic guidance. Reflect on your day, examine your thoughts with structured tools, and grow through Quran wisdom. Not therapy—reflection.
```

**Character Count:** 168/170 ✅

**Why This Works:**
- Opens with problem statement ("life's challenges")
- Explains what it is ("structured tools," "Quran wisdom")
- Clear disclaimer ("Not therapy—reflection")
- Actionable verbs ("Navigate," "Reflect," "Examine," "Grow")
- Front-loads "Islamic guidance" keyword

**Seasonal Update Example (Ramadan):**
```
Perfect for Ramadan reflection. Examine your thoughts with Islamic guidance, deepen your connection with Quran wisdom, and grow spiritually. Structured reflection tools.
