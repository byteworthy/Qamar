```
Transform your mental health with Noor—the Islamic mental health app combining evidence-based CBT therapy with authentic Quran wisdom. Whether you're struggling with anxiety, depression, or negative thoughts, Noor provides Muslim therapy tools grounded in both clinical psychology and Islamic faith.
```

**Keywords in First 300:**
- ✅ mental health (2x)
- ✅ Islamic mental health
- ✅ CBT therapy
- ✅ Quran
- ✅ anxiety
- ✅ depression
- ✅ Muslim therapy
- ✅ Islamic (2x)

**Why This Matters:** Google's algorithm gives exponentially more weight to keywords in the first 300 characters. This is non-negotiable.

### Keyword Density (Entire Description)

| Keyword | Occurrences | Density | Status |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|
| Islamic | 29 | High | ✅ Natural |
| mental health | 12 | High | ✅ Natural |

**Keyword Stuffing Check:** ✅ PASSED - All keywords appear naturally in context. No awkward repetition.

---

### Keyword Footer (Optional - Google Allows This)

At the very end of the description, I included:

- Industry-standard practice for Play Store ASO

Multiple CTAs throughout ("Bismillah, let's begin", "Download Noor", "Start your journey").
