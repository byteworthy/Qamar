# Noor

Noor is a faith-aligned thinking companion built for Muslims who want to examine their thoughts before acting on them. It provides a structured way to reflect, clarify assumptions, and set intention using calm prompts rooted in everyday reasoning and Islamic values.

**Structured thinking for Muslims seeking clarity, intention, and alignment.**

## Why Noor Exists

Modern life accelerates reaction.

Noor creates space between thought and action.

That space is where accountability lives.

## Philosophy

Islam places responsibility on thought, intention, and action.

Noor operationalizes that responsibility.

Reflection in Noor is not about expression or emotional release. It is about clarity, alignment, and intention. Thoughts are treated as something to examine, not indulge. Every session closes with niyyah—an intention that guides your next action.

## What Noor Does

**Structured reflection sessions**  
Walk through focused prompts that help you examine what you're thinking and whether it is true, useful, and aligned.

**Thought examination**  
Look carefully at your inner dialogue. Question assumptions. Test against reality and Islamic values.

**Reframing with clarity**  
Consider alternative explanations, Islamic principles, and broader context to shift understanding.

**Closing with intention**  
End each session with a clear niyyah—a commitment to what you'll do next.

## How It Works

1. **Capture a thought**  
   Write down what's on your mind—an anxious loop, a frustration, a spiritual tension.

2. **Examine it carefully**  
   Answer questions that help you see the thought from different angles and test its truth.

3. **Reframe with clarity**  
   Consider how Islamic values, alternative perspectives, or simple logic might shift your understanding.

4. **Close with intention**  
   Decide on one meaningful action that respects what you've learned.

## What Noor Is Not

Noor is not therapy. It does not diagnose, treat, or intervene.

It is a thinking practice designed to help you reflect before reacting, align intention before action, and carry clarity into daily life.

## Audience

Muslims seeking clarity, intention, and alignment.
