# Noor

Noor is a calm, disciplined thinking companion for Muslims. It helps you slow down thought, examine your inner dialogue, and act with intention. Through guided reflection sessions, Noor creates space between feeling and action—space where clarity, perspective, and grounded choice can emerge.

Structured thinking for Muslims whose minds feel noisy, circular, or spiritually conflicted.

## What Noor Does

**Guided reflection sessions**  
Walk through focused prompts that help you articulate what you're experiencing and why it matters.

**Thought examination**  
Look carefully at your inner dialogue without rushing to conclusions or getting lost in cycles.

**Reframing perspective**  
Shift how you view a situation by considering alternative explanations, Islamic principles, and broader context.

**Setting intention before action**  
Close each session with a clear, grounded commitment to what you'll do next.

## How It Works

1. **Capture a thought**  
   Write down what's on your mind—an anxious loop, a frustration, a spiritual tension.

2. **Examine it carefully**  
   Answer questions that help you see the thought from different angles.

3. **Reframe with clarity**  
   Consider how Islamic values, alternative perspectives, or simple logic might shift your understanding.

4. **Close with intention**  
   Decide on one meaningful action that respects what you've learned.
