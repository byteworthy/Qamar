Noor helps users slow down their thinking, examine inner dialogue with discipline, and reconnect intention with action using calm, guided reflection rooted in Islamic values.

---

## What Noor Helps With

- Slowing repetitive or circular thinking
- Clarifying intention before decisions
- Examining assumptions without judgment
- Practicing disciplined inner dialogue

---

## How Noor Works

Noor guides users through short, structured reflection sessions. Each session helps capture a thought, examine it carefully, reframe perspective, and set a grounded intention for action.

---

## Faith and Grounding

Noor is designed with Islamic values at its core. Concepts such as intention, patience, accountability, and trust are used as grounding lenses for reflection rather than as instruction or religious authority.

---

## AI Use and Boundaries

Noor uses AI carefully. Responses are constrained by a defined safety charter and an Islamic content framework designed to prevent overreach, moralizing, or theological drift.

---

## What Noor Is Not

- Not therapy
- Not medical care
- Not diagnosis
- Not religious authority

---

## Privacy

Reflections are stored locally on device. Users control their data and can delete it at any time.
