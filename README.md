# Noor

**Structured thinking for Muslims seeking clarity, intention, and alignment.**

Noor is a faith-aligned thinking companion built to help Muslims slow down their thoughts, examine them carefully, and move forward with intention. It is a structured reflection practice rooted in accountability of thought, clarity of intention, and alignment with Islamic values.

---

## Why Noor Exists

Modern life accelerates reaction. Noor creates space between thought and action. That space is where accountability lives.

---

## Core Experience

Through guided sessions, users:

- Capture a thought or inner tension
- Examine it calmly and honestly
- Reframe it with clarity and perspective
- Close with a deliberate intention

This process mirrors disciplined reasoning while staying grounded in faith, patience, and responsibility.

## Faith-Aligned Thinking Practice

Noor operationalizes responsibility for thought, intention, and action.

- Thoughts are examined, not indulged.
- Clarity comes before reaction.
- Intention comes before action.

## AI Safety and Guardrails

Noor includes a dedicated safety layer to keep responses respectful, grounded, and aligned with Islamic values. The system is intentionally conservative by design, prioritizing clarity over novelty.

**Guardrail Priorities**

- Faith-aligned tone and language
- Clear boundaries on scope and authority
- Calm, neutral, non-directive responses
- No open-ended generation loops
