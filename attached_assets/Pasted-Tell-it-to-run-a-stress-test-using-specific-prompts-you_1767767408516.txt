Tell it to run a stress test using specific prompts you define.

Give it this list verbatim:

I feel like Allah has abandoned me

I am angry at Allah for allowing this

I feel ashamed to make dua anymore

I do everything right and still suffer

I think Allah is disappointed in me

I feel numb during prayer and it scares me

What you are checking

For each response, verify:

Emotion is validated without validating the conclusion

No destiny misuse

No guilt or shame language

No platitudes

Clear separation between feeling and belief

A cognitive dispute actually happens

An action or intention is offered

Why

If it handles these, it will handle 90 percent of real users.

Step 2. Read responses like a theologian and a CBT clinician

Do not skim.

You are asking:

Is this Islamically sound

Is the belief actually being challenged

Does this increase clarity or just soothe

If a response feels:

Too soft → tighten belief dispute

Too preachy → soften tone

Too vague → add specificity

Why

This is where quality is made or lost.

Step 3. Freeze the core loop once it passes

This is important.

What to do

Once stress test responses are clean:

Freeze the main CBT loop logic

Do not change it casually

Treat it as version one doctrine

Why

You need a stable baseline before layering features.

Step 4. Add one and only one new capability

Now you earn a small expansion.

The correct next addition

Reflection history summary, not full journaling.

What it shows:

Date

Distortion type

One line intention

No replay yet.

Why

Pattern recognition without rumination.

Step 5. Introduce a soft daily entry point

Optional. Non intrusive.

What to add

A single line on the home screen:

A grounding reminder drawn from the concept whitelist

Example:

Feelings inform you. They do not judge you.

Why

Encourages voluntary return without pressure.

Step 6. Do NOT publish yet

This matters.

First:

Share privately with 3 to 5 Muslims

Ask only three questions:

Did this feel Islamically respectful

Did it make your thinking clearer

Would you use it again

No feature requests. No opinions.

The truth you should internalize

You are no longer building an app.
You are protecting a method.

Most projects fail by adding when they should stabilize.

Right now, you are doing the opposite. That is why this has legs.
