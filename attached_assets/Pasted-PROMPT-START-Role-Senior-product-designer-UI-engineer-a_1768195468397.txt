PROMPT START

Role
Senior product designer, UI engineer, and CBT plus NLP systems architect.

Context
Noor CBT is already modular with Reflection, Calming Practice, Dua, and Insights.
This task is polish, refinement, and realism.
Do not change architecture. Do not remove features. Do not weaken Islamic framing.

Primary goals
• Fix header clipping and spacing
• Improve UI polish to feel native and intentional
• Remove visible scroll bars and reduce scrolling friction
• Tighten Islamic tone to feel thoughtful, not aphoristic
• Seed realistic demo data so Insights feels alive
• Preserve all existing logic and Stripe gating

PART 1. Header and layout polish

Tasks
• Add safe area padding to all screens, especially Home
• Separate greeting text from logo visually with spacing
• Ensure “Salaam, Karim” is never clipped on web or mobile
• Center logo block vertically with breathing room
• Ensure consistent top spacing across all screens

Success criteria
• No text is clipped
• Header feels calm and intentional
• Greeting feels welcoming, not crowded

PART 2. Scroll behavior cleanup

Tasks
• Hide all vertical scroll indicators
• Remove visible browser scroll bar on web
• Use overflow hidden on root containers
• Allow internal scrolling where necessary but keep it subtle
• Break long text into multiple cards instead of one tall card

Success criteria
• App feels light to navigate
• No heavy scrolling required for comprehension
• No visible scroll bars

PART 3. Islamic tone tightening (do not add quotes)

Global rule
Islamic framing must support cognition, not replace it.

Tasks
• Review all user facing copy
• Reduce reminder style language
• Replace generic reassurance with clarity based language

Examples to apply broadly
Replace:
“Allah’s mercy is wider than whatever you’re worried about.”

With:
“Mercy allows you to face reality without despair.”

Replace:
“Trust Allah and be patient.”

With:
“Do what is yours to do, and let outcomes rest with Allah.”

Do not add verses.
Do not preach.
Do not moralize.

PART 4. Seed demo data for Insights

When demo mode is enabled:
• Seed 8 to 12 reflections across different states
• Include realistic timestamps and variation
• Generate recurring assumptions such as:
  - Responsibility equals control
  - Feeling anxious means danger
  - Struggle means failure
• Generate a Pattern Summary paragraph based on this data

Pattern Summary tone
• Observational
• Neutral
• No advice
• No encouragement

Example style (do not hardcode text)
“Across your reflections, responsibility often appears before rest. Effort is present, but trust arrives later.”

Insights must feel useful even before real data exists.

PART 5. Modular clarity reinforcement

Tasks
• Ensure each module can be entered independently
• Do not auto push user into reflection flow
• Ensure completion of Calm Practice or Dua returns cleanly to Home
• Keep Reflection as the deepest path, not the default

---

PART 6. Preserve non negotiables

Do not change:
• App name
• Logo
• Color palette
• Stripe integration
• Pro gating logic
• Completion line:
  “May Allah make it easy for you.”

This line must remain exactly as is and visually centered.

---

PART 7. Quality checks

Verify:
• Header text never clips
• Scroll bars are hidden
• Demo Insights display meaningful content
• Islamic tone feels intelligent and grounded
• Reflection flow still works end to end
• Pro gating remains intact

Deliverables
• Polished UI
• Improved readability
• Demo data seeded
• No regressions
