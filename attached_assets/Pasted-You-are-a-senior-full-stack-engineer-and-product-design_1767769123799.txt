You are a senior full stack engineer and product designer. The app is working. Do not change the core flow logic. This task is a focused rebrand and copy refinement based on the current screenshots.

Goal
Rebrand the app to Noor CBT as the parent brand, while keeping Siraat as the internal method name.

Brand architecture
Parent brand name shown in the UI: Noor CBT
Method name shown in the UI: The Siraat Method
Do not show Siraat as the app title anywhere after this change. It can appear only as the method name.

Global text replacements
Replace app title Siraat with Noor CBT
Replace tagline Cognition aligned with truth, not mood with a Noor centered line

New tagline options, choose one and apply consistently
Option A
Clarity through faith and reason
Option B
Light for the mind, rooted in Islam
Option C
Untangle thoughts, return with clarity

Home screen changes
Current quote card is fine but make it shorter and more Noor aligned. Use one line only. Rotate from a small approved list.

Create a list called dailyAnchorConcepts using only concept level statements, no verse dumps
Examples
Mercy exceeds sin
Effort is required, outcomes belong to Allah
Hearts fluctuate and return remains open
Hardship can carry wisdom you cannot yet see
Trust does not cancel action
No soul is burdened beyond capacity
Delay is not denial

Home screen sections
Top
Logo icon stays
Title becomes Noor CBT
Subtext becomes the chosen tagline

Primary CTA
Change Start Reflection to Begin Reflection

Secondary link
Keep View Past Reflections

Footer disclaimer
Update to this exact text and keep it small
Noor CBT is a guided reflection tool. It does not diagnose, treat, or cure any condition.

Method callout
Add a small line on the home screen under the CTA area
Powered by the Siraat Method

Flow screen copy changes
Keep the current screen structure. Only tighten text and readability.

Capture screen
Header stays but tighten subcopy
Current
Write openly and honestly. Your thoughts are private and held with compassion. There is no judgment here.
Replace with
Write what is on your mind. This is private. No shame. No judgment.

Reflection screen
Change title What we noticed to Reflection
Change the two distortion pills styling so text never breaks awkwardly. Keep them as single line or allow clean wrap with better padding.

Reduce the long paragraph into three parts with headings
Use this structure
What is happening
One short paragraph
The thinking pattern
Two bullets naming the distortions and one line each
What matters
One short paragraph that validates emotion without agreeing with the distorted conclusion

Reframe screen
Change header A Different Perspective to Clearer Perspective
Keep the current logic but shorten output.

Reframe output format
You must produce the reframe as three blocks
Block 1
The belief being tested
One sentence
Block 2
A truer perspective
Two to three sentences max, grounded in the concept whitelist
Block 3
One next step
One simple action that can be done today

At the bottom show a small line labeled Anchors used and list two to four concept names only, not verse text

Calming Practice screen
Keep the practice but reduce text length and increase scannability
Format as
Steps
1
2
3
Then a single line reminder

Set Intention screen
Header stays Set Your Niyyah
Subcopy stays but shorten
Replace with
Choose one small action aligned with this new perspective.

Remove the full reframe block from this screen. It is too long.
Instead show a short summary called Your anchor in one sentence, pulled from the Block 2 above.

Completion screen
Header stays Reflection Complete
Replace subtext You have taken a step on the straight path with a Noor aligned line
Options
Option A
You chose clarity today
Option B
You returned with intention
Option C
A small step, real light

Then show two cards only
Your Niyyah
Your anchor

Design constraints
Keep the Yemeni inspired aesthetic. Do not change the palette drastically.
Improve readability by increasing line height on long text blocks and limiting paragraph width inside cards.

Implementation notes
Perform changes by updating constants and copy maps rather than hard coded strings scattered across components.
Create a single file for brand copy and labels, then import it across screens.

Deliverable
A working build with the same flow, updated branding to Noor CBT, Siraat Method displayed as the internal method, shorter copy, better readability, and consistent labels.
