You are a senior brand designer, product designer, and front end engineer. The Noor CBT app is functional. Do not add features. Do not change the reflection flow. This task is brand sharpening only across three areas:

Logo icon direction

Home screen tension copy

Primary call to action language

The objective is to make Noor CBT feel disciplined, intellectually serious, and memorable, not like a generic Islamic template. Keep the calm Yemeni inspired atmosphere, but increase cognitive pull and brand authority.

Non negotiables

Keep the existing color palette and overall calm tone

Keep the app name Noor CBT

Keep Siraat as the internal method name, shown as Powered by the Siraat Method

Do not introduce stars, crescents, lanterns, brains, hearts, light bulbs, or glow effects

Do not add new screens or features

Do not add verse dumps or long religious quotes

Keep typography serious, scholarly, and restrained

Section 1. Logo icon redesign direction

The current arch icon is directionally correct but feels decorative and generic. Replace it with a mark that communicates cognitive structure, clarity, and focus, inspired by Yemeni architectural geometry but simplified into a modern, disciplined form.

Icon requirements

Must feel like a framework or lens, not a place or doorway

Must be minimal, symmetric, and built from clean geometry

Must use strong negative space

Must work at small sizes as an app icon and favicon

Must work in monochrome

Must feel appropriate for a scholarly book cover or manuscript stamp

Choose ONE concept and implement it

Option A. The Frame
A simplified geometric frame inspired by Yemeni window geometry, reduced to a single continuous outline with a structured inner void. The inner void should act as a focal point, suggesting ordering of thought.

Option B. The Mihrab Linework
A mihrab inspired outline reduced to two or three nested line layers that imply depth and reflection. No ornamentation. Strict geometry. It must feel like a cognitive container, not a mosque symbol.

Option C. The Lens Gate
A square or rounded square form with a centered aperture. The aperture suggests focus and clarity. Use symmetry and negative space to imply light without rays or glow.

Implementation rules

Deliver SVG only

Flat color only, no gradients inside the icon

Single source of truth for the icon in the codebase

Replace the existing icon wherever it appears, including app header and meta icons

Section 2. Home screen tension copy

Replace the current quote system with short, cognitively activating anchor lines that create gentle tension and relevance. These must remain Islam aligned at a concept level, not preachy.

Create a list called homeAnchors

12 to 18 entries

One line each

Maximum 62 characters where possible

Crisp, memorable, intellectually grounded

Anchor rules

No verse references

No long sentences

No guilt language

No motivational fluff

Must invite reflection and challenge assumptions

Must align with effort, trust, mercy, accountability, and return

Style examples to match

Not every thought deserves your trust.

Feelings are real. Conclusions are testable.

Faith is alignment, not denial.

Clarity begins when assumptions get questioned.

Effort is yours. Outcomes belong to Allah.

Mercy is bigger than your worst moment.

Return is always open. Even now.

Trust does not cancel action.

Your heart can feel heavy and still be guided.

Your worth is not your outcome.

Behavior

Display one anchor line in the quote card area

Rotate daily or per app open, but keep stable during a session

Ensure strong contrast, padding, and readability

Do not italicize long text blocks

Section 3. Primary call to action language

The current CTA is accurate but passive. Update it to feel inviting, grounded, and clarity driven, without sounding salesy or instructional.

Replace the primary CTA with

Return to Clarity

Replace the CTA subcopy with

Slow the mind. Examine the thought. Realign with what’s true.

Do not change any other copy, screens, or logic.

CTA must

Feel like a gentle invitation, not a command

Be centered visually and emotionally

Match the calm, serious Noor CBT tone

Remain prominent and readable

Do not add explanation text.
Do not add religious quotes.
Do not add clinical language.

Optional supporting paragraph under CTA card

Reduce to two sentences max. Choose one and apply consistently.

Option A
Slow down. Name the thought. Find a clearer perspective rooted in Islam.

Option B
Write what is weighing on you. Walk it through a faith grounded reframe.

Option C
Capture the thought driving your stress. Replace distortion with clarity.

Micro brand refinements for authority

Apply globally where relevant:

Prefer test language over try language
Replace “You might also try” with
Another way to test this thought is

Prefer clarity language over comfort language
Use words like clarity, perspective, test, assumption, align, return
Avoid words like healing, glow, transform, manifest

Design constraints

Keep the existing palette and overall mood

Improve perceived quality via spacing, line height, and card width only

Ensure the title and icon lockup feels intentional and centered

Keep Powered by the Siraat Method visible but understated

Deliverables

New logo icon implemented as SVG using the chosen concept

Updated homeAnchors list and rotation behavior

Updated home CTA button text and subcopy

No changes to reflection flow beyond copy consistency

Build passes and full reflection journey works end to end
