PROMPT START

Role
Senior product engineer and copy implementer.

Context
Noor CBT app.

Non negotiables
Do not add new screens. Do not add new features. Do not change navigation. Do not change the reflection flow steps. Do not change the palette, logo, or typography direction. This is a precision copy and intelligence tuning update only.

Goal
1. Lock home screen copy word for word.
2. Enforce a single question per reflection step.
3. Add silent adaptive tone intelligence that shifts phrasing for thinkers versus feelers without exposing any settings or labels.
4. Add silent state inference and assumption pattern recognition to improve precision.
5. Prepare return summaries logic but do not surface it yet.

PART 1
Home screen copy update. Implement exactly. No paraphrasing. No alternates. No rotation. No italic styling.

Footer disclaimer
Leave unchanged and do not increase prominence.

PART 2
Copy governing rule for reflection content generation. Apply silently. No UI changes.

Rule
Every reflection step answers only one question.

Enforce these step purposes
Capture Your Thought
Only capture, no reframing language.

Reflection screen
Answer: What is happening and what is the thinking pattern.
Do not include next steps here.

Clearer Perspective screen
Answer: What truth sits alongside this and what is the tested belief.
Do not include calming practice here.

Calming Practice screen
Answer: What is one practice to settle the heart and body.
Do not include additional analysis here.

Set Intention screen
Answer: What is one aligned action.
Do not include additional reframing here.

Prohibit
Do not combine comfort, teaching, and reframing in the same step.

PART 3
Depth expansions. No new UI. No new screens. Internal intelligence only.

3.1
State based interpretation. Highest priority.

Before generating any reflection content, infer the user’s inner state, not their topic.

Supported states list
Tightness around provision
Fear of loss
Shame after sin
Justified anger
Feeling unseen
Confusion between effort and control
Gratitude that feels overwhelming

Use the detected state to subtly adjust tone and word choice across the existing reflection screens.

Do not label the state for the user.
Do not show the state in UI.
Do not store the state in a way that is displayed.

3.2
Assumption pattern recognition. Silent feature.

Internally recognize recurring assumptions such as
If I suffer, Allah is displeased
If I fail, I am unworthy
If I feel anxious, something bad will happen
If I am patient, outcomes should change
If I do good, Allah owes me ease

When detected
Reflect the assumption gently.
Test it clearly.
Do not moralize.
Do not quote verses excessively.
Keep it precise and disciplined.

3.3
Return summaries. Prepare only.

Track themes across multiple reflections.
After several reflections, generate a single paragraph summary that
Observes patterns
Avoids advice
Avoids encouragement language
Feels like a wise, neutral observer

Do not surface this yet unless the product already supports a place to show it.
Prepare the logic only.

PART 4
Adaptive tone intelligence. Implement silently. No settings. No labels. No personas.

Goal
Adjust sentence framing for thinkers versus feelers while keeping the same truth and same reflection flow.

Define tone modes
Thinkers mode
Emphasize structure, sequencing, assumptions, tests, and clarity language.
Example framing pattern
This thought is placing responsibility where control does not exist.

Feelers mode
Emphasize emotional naming, weight language, acknowledgment before testing.
Example framing pattern
It sounds heavy to carry everything as if it depends only on you.

How to infer tone preference silently
Use signals from user input and reflection history
Sentence length
Emotional language density
Abstract versus concrete phrasing
Repeated reflection patterns

If signals are mixed or low confidence
Use balanced neutral tone.

Rules
No user facing choice.
No UI toggle.
No quiz.
No personality naming.
No spiritual flattery.
No over customization.
Do not change the Siraat Method structure.
Only adjust sentence framing and ordering within each step’s single question constraint.

Implementation approach
Create a small internal tone classifier utility that returns thinkers, feelers, or balanced with confidence score.
Pass that tone into the AI prompt template and response shaping for each step.

PART 5
Design and tone constraints
Keep existing color palette.
Keep existing logo and icon.
Maintain scholarly restrained typography.
Avoid decorative religious symbols.
Prefer test language over try language.
Prefer clarity language over comfort language.
Avoid aphorism style slogans inside the reflection flow.
Avoid long quote dumps.

SUCCESS CRITERIA
Home screen copy matches exactly.
Anchor line is static and not italic.
CTA subcopy is three short separated sentences.
Reflection journey still passes end to end.
Generated content stays single question per screen.
Tone adapts silently without any visible settings.
Build passes.
