You are a senior product designer and brand specialist working inside an already functioning Noor CBT app. Do not add features. Do not change the palette. Do not change the reflection flow. Your job is brand sharpness: logo refinement direction, homepage tension copy, and CTA micro shift.

High level goal
Make Noor CBT feel less like a generic Islamic app template and more like an intellectually grounded clarity tool. Keep it calm, but increase cognitive authority and memorability.

Do these tasks in order.

Logo mark refinement direction
Current arch mark is directionally correct but still feels generic and decorative. Replace it with a mark that communicates structure and cognition, not place.

Constraints
No stars
No crescents
No lanterns
No brains or hearts
No rays or glow effects
No ornate details that disappear at icon size

Design direction
Use Yemeni inspired geometry and negative space, but reduce it to a modern framework like symbol.

Aim for one of these forms
Option A
A minimal abstract mihrab reduced to straight lines, like a frame or doorway outline, with strong negative space and geometric balance

Option B
A nested frame motif suggesting layers of thought, like two or three stepped outlines forming an arch like geometry, minimal and architectural

Option C
A single monoline geometric emblem inspired by Yemeni window lattice, simplified to a crisp mark that reads as a lens or structure

Implementation note
Update the SVG or icon component used on the home screen and app header. Ensure it works in one color. Ensure it reads at small sizes. Keep within the existing palette.

Homepage quote card, increase cognitive tension
Replace the current daily anchor quote list with a new set that is still Islamic aligned but more cognitively activating. These must be short, one line, and not preachy.

Replace the dailyAnchorConcepts list with these lines exactly
Not every thought deserves your trust
Feelings are real. Conclusions are testable
Faith is alignment, not denial
Clarity begins when assumptions are questioned
Effort is yours. Outcomes belong to Allah
Return is always open
Hardship can hold wisdom
Trust does not cancel action
Mercy exceeds sin
No soul is burdened beyond capacity

Display one at random per load, same as current behavior.

CTA micro shift
Change the primary button label from Begin Reflection to Untangle Your Thoughts

Keep secondary navigation the same.

Micro copy tightening for authority
On the Begin Your Reflection card, replace the body copy with a tighter version:

Current body copy should be replaced with
Slow down. Name the thought. Test it against truth. Take one small step.

Keep the Powered by the Siraat Method line.

Design constraints
Do not change the overall layout, spacing system, or palette. Only update the logo asset and copy. Ensure contrast and readability remain strong.

Deliverable
Commit the changes, run the existing end to end test, and confirm the home screen now feels more intellectually grounded and less decorative.
