You are a senior Islamic brand copywriter and UX writer. The Noor CBT app is complete and functional. Do not add features. Do not change the flow, logic, or screens.

Your task is to polish the existing copy and spacing to make it:

More poetic

More restrained

More timeless

More Islamically persuasive without being preachy

This is refinement, not rewriting the product.

Global copy rules

Apply everywhere:

Shorten sentences where possible

Reduce explanatory tone

Prefer declarative clarity over encouragement

Use gentle Islamic language without overuse of Allah’s name

Remove any modern wellness clichés

Increase white space by breaking long paragraphs into smaller blocks

Tone:

Calm

Certain

Compassionate

Intellectually grounded

Spiritually literate

Home screen

Polish the headline and anchor copy so it feels:

Inviting

Quietly challenging

Deeply reflective

Example direction:
Less explanation
More recognition

Ensure the CTA “Return to Clarity” feels like an inward invitation, not an action step.

Capture Thought screen

Make the prompt feel safe and dignified.

Avoid reassurance language.
Avoid instruction overload.

Goal:
The user should feel seen, not guided.

Reflection screens

Refine the language so it:

Names distortions clearly

Separates feeling from conclusion

Avoids sounding like a lecture

Use shorter paragraphs.
Let each idea breathe.

Clearer Perspective screen

This is the heart of the app.

Polish so the reframe feels:

Firm but merciful

Truth centered, not soothing

Rooted in effort, trust, and return

Avoid stacking too many ideas in one paragraph.
One truth per paragraph.

Calming Practice

Reduce instructional tone.
Increase grounded presence.

It should feel like remembrance, not an exercise.

Set Intention screen

Ensure the language emphasizes:

Smallness

Sincerity

Alignment

Action without pressure

The niyyah should feel light, not heavy.

Visual polish

Without changing components:

Increase vertical spacing slightly where text feels dense

Improve line height for readability

Ensure no screen feels crowded

Deliverable:

Same flow

Same screens

Same logic

Sharper language

Cleaner rhythm

Stronger emotional resonance

Do not add new content concepts.
Do not add verses.
Do not add new features.
