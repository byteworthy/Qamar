You are a senior full stack engineer, UX designer, and cognitive behavioral psychology implementer with deep respect for Islamic theology.

Build a web based MVP called Siraat, an Islamic cognitive behavioral therapy application.

Core purpose

Siraat helps Muslim users slow down their thoughts, identify cognitive distortions, reframe them using Quran and authentic Sunnah aligned reasoning, regulate emotions through short faith based practices, and set a clear intention for action.

This is not a motivational app.
This is not a reminder app.
This is not Western CBT with Islamic quotes added.

Islam is the cognitive framework.
CBT is the method.

Core user flow

Single linear flow. No branching.

Thought Capture
A text input asking the user to write what is troubling their mind right now.

Distortion Identification
Analyze the thought and identify one or two cognitive distortions using Islamic aligned language such as despair of mercy, over attachment to dunya outcome, mind reading, catastrophizing, emotional reasoning.

Islamic Cognitive Reframe
Generate one concise reframe that:

Corrects the belief error

Is grounded in Quran or authentic hadith meaning without long quotations

Is emotionally validating without affirming distortion

Regulation Practice
Provide one under two minute practice such as:

Slow breathing with dhikr count

Grounded remembrance

Gratitude recall
This should calm the nervous system so the reframe can land.

Intention Reset
Prompt the user to set one simple niyyah aligned with the reframe.

Session ends after intention.

Total session time under five minutes.

Psychological rules

Never shame the user

Never preach

Never invalidate emotions

Always separate feeling from truth claim

Always anchor reframes in Islamic worldview

Always offer a behavioral micro step or intention

Theological boundaries

Use Quran and authentic hadith concepts only

No speculative metaphysics

No claims of healing or guarantees

Emphasize effort, trust, and return

Avoid fatalism and avoid self blame

UI requirements

Single page application

Calm Yemeni inspired aesthetic

Earth tones and warm lighting feel

Arabic geometric accents used subtly

Clean readable layout

Mobile first responsive design

Technical stack

Frontend React with clean component structure

Backend minimal Node or serverless logic

Prompt driven AI logic with clear separation between:

Thought analysis

Distortion labeling

Reframe generation

Regulation practice

Intention generation

Structure prompts so they are editable and expandable later.

Deliverables

Functional MVP with the full CBT loop

Clean UI matching the aesthetic direction

Clear prompt logic documented in code comments

Ready for rapid iteration

Build this as a foundation, not a finished cathedral.

PROMPT END

Why this prompt works

It constrains scope so Replit does not overbuild

It locks theology so the app stays clean

It centers CBT mechanics so results are real

It gives design direction without micromanaging

This is enough to get something real on screen fast.

Next step after Replit generates the first version

We review three things only:

Is the cognitive reframe actually correct

Does the tone feel grounded not preachy

Does the UI feel calming or distracting

Once those are dialed in, we expand.
