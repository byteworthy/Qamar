Role
Senior product designer plus front end engineer

Context
Noor CBT is functional. Do not add features. Do not change any flows. This task is pure UI and UX polish. Keep the palette, keep the logo, keep the copy. Only layout, spacing, typography, and component sizing.

Goal
Fix spacing and scale across Home, Calming Practice, Dua, Insights so everything fits cleanly on small screens. Remove cramped feeling. Make the Home screen feel centered and intentional, like a calm tool chest, not a list jammed at the top.

Non negotiables
Keep existing palette and logo
Keep all existing copy and module set
No new screens
No new navigation
No new feature work
No new symbols or decorative religious motifs
Do not rewrite any text
Do not add extra text

Part 1 Global layout system

Create a single layout constants file and use it everywhere
Create client theme layout constants, for example client theme layout.ts, and export:

spacing
xs 6
sm 10
md 14
lg 18
xl 24
xxl 32

radii
sm 12
md 16
lg 20

container
maxWidth 420
screenPad 16
cardPad 14

type scale
title 22
h2 18
body 14
small 12

Add a Screen wrapper component and use it on every screen
Create client components Screen.tsx that applies:

Safe area friendly padding top and padding bottom
Horizontal padding screenPad
Max width container.maxWidth
Align self center
Flex 1
Background color unchanged
Content container style for scroll views with padding bottom 24

Use it on HomeScreen, CalmingPracticeListScreen, CalmingPracticeDetailScreen, Dua screens, Insights, Upgrade screen, Reflection screens only if needed to fix clipping.

Fix header clipping universally
Wrap all screen content under the header in a View with paddingTop spacing.md.
Ensure the topmost visible title never starts at y 0.
If using React Navigation headers, also set headerTitleStyle and headerStyle to match spacing, but do not change copy.

Part 2 Home screen centering and hierarchy

Objective
Home should sit visually centered with breathing room, not stuck to the top. Keep it scrollable, but make the primary block feel like it lives in the middle.

Implement

Add vertical rhythm
In HomeScreen main container:

Use flexGrow 1
Add justifyContent center only when content height is less than screen height
Implement with a wrapper that has flexGrow 1 and a child that has paddingVertical spacing.xl
Do not hard center everything. Use a soft center, meaning content starts around upper middle.

Brand block spacing
Increase space between greeting row, logo lockup, and anchor card.

Greeting row
One line, left aligned, with small font and reduced opacity. Add bottom margin spacing.sm.

Logo plus app name row
Make logo 40 to 44 size, not larger. Keep aligned with title baseline. Add gap spacing.sm. Add bottom margin spacing.sm.

Tagline
Font small, opacity slightly reduced. Add bottom margin spacing.lg.

Anchor card
Make anchor card full width within maxWidth, with cardPad padding.
Ensure text wraps nicely with lineHeight about 18 to 20.
Add marginBottom spacing.lg.

Module cards list
Convert the 4 module cards into a consistent vertical stack with:

Card height minimum 64
Padding horizontal cardPad, padding vertical spacing.sm
Icon column fixed width 28
Title font 16, subtitle font 12
Right chevron aligned center
Gap between cards spacing.sm

Primary pro button row
The Unlock button should not float awkwardly. Add marginTop spacing.lg and marginBottom spacing.md. Keep width full.

Footer disclaimer spacing
Add marginTop spacing.lg and paddingBottom spacing.lg so it never kisses the bottom.

Part 3 Calming Practice list and detail screens

List screen
The title area is currently cramped and the list feels top heavy.

Add Screen wrapper
Add a top title block with paddingBottom spacing.md
Increase list item spacing to spacing.sm
Increase hit area by setting minHeight 64

Detail screen
Ensure numbered steps card has:

Padding cardPad
Line height 18 to 20
Each step row has gap spacing.sm and marginBottom spacing.sm
The Done button sits above bottom safe area with marginBottom spacing.lg

Part 4 Dua flow screens

Category list screens
The back button and title should not fight.

Use Screen wrapper
Add top title marginBottom spacing.lg
Each row minHeight 56, paddingHorizontal cardPad
Keep chevron aligned center

Dua result screen
Arabic block must be visually dominant without causing overflow.

Arabic text
Font size 22 to 26 depending on available width
LineHeight 34 to 38
TextAlign center
Wrap in a card with padding cardPad and marginBottom spacing.md

Transliteration and meaning
Font 12 to 14 with increased lineHeight
Keep them in separate blocks with spacing.sm

Button
Full width, marginTop spacing.lg, marginBottom spacing.lg

Part 5 Insights screen layout fixes

Issues
Pattern summary and chips feel jammed, and the recent reflections area begins too close to the bottom.

Implement

Use Screen wrapper with ScrollView contentContainerStyle paddingBottom spacing.xxl
Add consistent section spacing:

Section label marginTop spacing.lg, marginBottom spacing.sm
Cards marginBottom spacing.sm
Chips wrap with gap spacing.sm and ensure they do not clip horizontally

Recent reflections list
Each row minHeight 64, padding cardPad, marginBottom spacing.sm
Add bottom spacing so last item is never hidden behind home indicator

Part 6 Upgrade screen polish

Ensure the two plan cards have:

Full width within maxWidth
Padding cardPad
Title 18, price 22, features 13
Consistent feature row spacing
Upgrade button full width and anchored with marginBottom spacing.lg

Part 7 Remove web scrollbars without breaking mobile

If this is Expo web, ensure the scrollbar hiding is applied globally, but do not rely only on body overflow hidden. Use:

ScrollView showsVerticalScrollIndicator false on every ScrollView
FlatList showsVerticalScrollIndicator false if used
On web, set documentElement and body overflow hidden only if the app has internal scrolling handled correctly. Otherwise keep overflow auto but hide scrollbar via CSS.
