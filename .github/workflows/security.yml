# Security Analysis Workflow
#
# This workflow runs CodeQL static analysis security testing (SAST) to detect
# security vulnerabilities in JavaScript and TypeScript code.
#
# Triggers:
# - Every pull request to main branch
# - Weekly schedule (Mondays at 6 AM UTC)
#
# What it detects:
# - SQL injection, XSS, path traversal
# - Insecure cryptography
# - Command injection
# - Unsafe deserialization
# - Authentication/authorization issues
#
# Results appear in: GitHub Security tab → Code scanning alerts
