# Dependabot Configuration
#
# Automatically creates pull requests to update dependencies weekly.
# This keeps the project secure by updating packages with known vulnerabilities.
#
# Schedule: Every Monday at 6 AM UTC
# PR limits: 5 for npm, 2 for GitHub Actions (prevents overwhelming number of PRs)
# Grouping: Related dependencies updated together (Expo, React, testing, TypeScript)
#
# Review process:
# 1. Dependabot creates PR with changelog
# 2. CI runs tests automatically
# 3. Review changes and approve if tests pass
# 4. Merge to apply updates
