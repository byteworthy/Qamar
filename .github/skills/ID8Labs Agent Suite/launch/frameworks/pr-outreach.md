## Outreach Philosophy

### For Solo Builders

**Reality check:**
- Traditional PR is expensive and often low ROI
- Journalists get hundreds of pitches daily
- Influencer marketing can work but is hit-or-miss

**What works:**
- Personal, genuine outreach
- Unique story angles
- Providing real value first
- Building relationships over time

## Press Outreach

### When to Pursue Press

**Worth it:**
- Truly newsworthy angle (not just "I launched")
- Relevant niche publications
- Local/regional press
- Industry-specific outlets

**Not worth it (for solo):**
- Major tech publications (TechCrunch, etc.)
- General press
- Pay-for-play schemes

### Finding Relevant Journalists

**Search queries:**
```
"[industry] journalist"
"[topic] reporter"
"[publication] [industry]"
site:twitter.com "[topic] journalist"
```

**Where to find:**
- Publication staff pages
- Twitter/X bios
- LinkedIn
- Substack newsletters
