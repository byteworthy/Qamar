# Positioning Framework

## Purpose

Define how your product is perceived in the market. Good positioning makes marketing easier and more effective.

## Why Positioning Matters

**Without positioning:**
- Generic messaging
- Compete on features/price
- Easily forgettable

**With positioning:**
- Clear differentiation
- Attract right customers
- Repel wrong customers
- Premium pricing possible

## Positioning Elements

### The Five Questions

1. **Who is this for?** (Target audience)
2. **What is the pain?** (Problem)
3. **What category are you in?** (Frame of reference)
4. **Why are you different?** (Differentiator)
5. **Why should they believe you?** (Proof)

### Positioning Statement Formula

```
For [target customer]
who [statement of need/opportunity]
[Product name] is a [product category]
that [statement of key benefit]
Unlike [competitor]
our product [statement of differentiation]
```

## Differentiation Strategies

### Types of Differentiation

| Strategy | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| **Feature** | Unique capability | Notion's databases |
| **Price** | Significantly cheaper | Plausible vs GA |
| **Experience** | Better UX | Linear vs Jira |
| **Segment** | Serve niche better | ConvertKit for creators |
| **Integration** | Connect better | Zapier's ecosystem |
| **Philosophy** | Different approach | Basecamp's simplicity |

### Solo Builder Sweet Spots

Best differentiation for solo builders:

1. **Niche focus** - Serve one segment extremely well
2. **Simplicity** - Do one thing better than bloated alternatives
3. **Price** - Indie pricing vs enterprise bloat
4. **Experience** - Personal touch, responsive support
5. **Speed** - Ship features faster than big companies

## Category Strategy

### Option 1: Existing Category

**What:** Position as better solution in known category
**Example:** "A better project management tool"
**Pros:** Market exists, easy to understand
**Cons:** Direct competition, feature wars

**When to use:**
- Clear improvement over incumbents
- Market is large enough to capture share

### Option 2: Subcategory

**What:** Create new niche within existing category
**Example:** "Project management for creative agencies"
**Pros:** Own a segment, less competition
**Cons:** Smaller market, must prove segment exists

**When to use:**
- Underserved segment exists
- Deep expertise in the segment

### Option 3: New Category

**What:** Create entirely new category
**Example:** "Team collaboration" (Slack created this)
**Pros:** No direct competition, define the rules
**Cons:** Must educate market, high risk

**When to use:**
- Truly novel approach
- Resources for market education
- (Usually not recommended for solo)

                        │
         "Premium"      │      "Enterprise"
         (Few features, │      (Many features,
          high quality) │       high price)
                        │
    ────────────────────┼────────────────────
    SIMPLE              │              COMPLEX
                        │
         "Budget"       │      "Feature-rich"
         (Few features, │      (Many features,
          low price)    │       low price)
                        │

**Common axes:**
- Price vs Features

## Target Audience Definition

### Be Specific

**Bad:** "Small businesses"
**Good:** "Solo freelance designers earning $50K-150K"

**Bad:** "Developers"
**Good:** "Frontend developers at startups building React apps"

## Messaging Hierarchy

### Three Levels

**Level 1: Tagline (2-5 words)**
- Memorable phrase
- Captures essence
- Used everywhere

**Level 2: One-liner (10-15 words)**
- What it is + who it's for
- Used in intros, social

**Level 3: Value proposition (2-3 sentences)**
- Problem + solution + benefit
- Used on landing page

### Examples

**Basecamp:**
- Tagline: "The All-In-One Toolkit"
- One-liner: "Basecamp is a project management tool for remote teams"
- Value prop: "Frustrated with scattered projects? Basecamp puts everything in one place so your team always knows what's happening."

**Linear:**
- Tagline: "Linear is a better way to build products"
- One-liner: "Issue tracking that doesn't slow you down"

## Competitor Analysis

### For Each Competitor

| Aspect | Competitor | Your Position |
|--------|------------|---------------|
| Category | {their category} | {same/different} |
| Target | {their audience} | {same/different} |
| Key message | {their pitch} | {your counter} |
| Strengths | {what they do well} | {how you respond} |
| Weaknesses | {what they lack} | {your opportunity} |

### Positioning Against

| Competitor Type | Strategy |
|-----------------|----------|
| Market leader | Focus on what they can't do well |
| Similar size | Clear differentiation needed |
| Cheaper option | Emphasize value, not price |
| Free option | Emphasize quality, support |

---

## Positioning Test

### Validation Questions

Answer these. If you struggle, positioning needs work:

- [ ] Can you explain what you do in 10 seconds?
- [ ] Do people "get it" without explanation?
- [ ] Can you clearly state why you're different?
- [ ] Do you know exactly who this is for?
- [ ] Can you name specific competitors?
- [ ] Would your ideal customer recognize themselves?

### Red Flags

- "It's like X but better" (not specific)
- "It's for everyone" (not focused)
- "We have more features" (feature war)
- Can't name alternatives (no market)
- Long explanation needed (too complex)
