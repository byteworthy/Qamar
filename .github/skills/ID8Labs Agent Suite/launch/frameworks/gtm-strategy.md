## GTM Strategy Types

### For Solo Builders

| Strategy | Description | Best For | Time to Results |
|----------|-------------|----------|-----------------|
| **Community-first** | Build in public, launch to followers | Products with builder appeal | Months |
| **Platform launch** | Product Hunt, HN, Reddit | B2B tools, dev tools | Days |
| **Content-led** | SEO, blogging, YouTube | Long-term sustainable growth | 6-12 months |
| **Direct outreach** | Cold email, DMs, networking | High-value B2B | Weeks |
| **Partnership** | Integrate with established product | Complementary tools | Variable |

### Not Recommended for Solo

| Strategy | Why Not |
|----------|---------|
| Paid acquisition | Expensive, requires optimization expertise |
| Enterprise sales | Long cycles, relationship-heavy |
| Mass PR | Expensive, low ROI without existing traction |
| Multi-channel blitz | Spread too thin, can't execute well |

## Strategy Selection

### Decision Tree

```
Do you have an existing audience?
├── Yes (>1000 followers/subscribers)
│   └── Launch to audience, then expand
│
└── No
    ├── Is your product visual/demonstrable?
    │   ├── Yes → Product Hunt, Show HN
    │   └── No → Reddit communities, cold outreach
    │
    └── Do you have time (6+ months)?
        ├── Yes → Content/SEO strategy
        └── No → Direct outreach + community
```
