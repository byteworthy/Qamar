## Verdict Decision Framework

### BUILD Criteria (all should be true)

- [ ] Market opportunity exists and is appropriately sized
- [ ] Competition is not insurmountable
- [ ] Evidence of real demand from community signals
- [ ] Founder fit is at least moderate
- [ ] Execution is feasible within constraints
- [ ] Risks are acceptable and mitigatable

### PIVOT Criteria

- [ ] Core problem is validated BUT
- [ ] Current solution approach is flawed OR
- [ ] Target audience needs adjustment OR
- [ ] Positioning needs refinement
- [ ] AND: A clear pivot direction exists

### KILL Criteria (any can trigger)

- [ ] No evidence of real demand
- [ ] Market too small or declining
- [ ] Competition too strong with no gap
- [ ] Poor founder fit with no path to improve
- [ ] Risks are unacceptable
- [ ] Resources insufficient with no path to acquire

## Confidence Level Guidelines

| Level | Criteria |
|-------|----------|
| **High** | Strong evidence in all categories, consistent signals, low uncertainty |
| **Medium** | Good evidence in most categories, some mixed signals, moderate uncertainty |
| **Low** | Limited evidence, conflicting signals, high uncertainty |

When confidence is Low, note what additional research would increase confidence.
