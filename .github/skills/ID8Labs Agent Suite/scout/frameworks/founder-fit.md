# Founder Fit Framework

## Purpose

Assess whether YOU should build THIS idea. Answer: "Am I the right person for this?"

**Philosophy:** Even great ideas fail when built by the wrong person. Fit matters.

## Fit Dimensions

### 1. Skills Fit

**Technical skills required vs available:**

| Skill Area | Required Level | Your Level | Gap |
|------------|----------------|------------|-----|
| Frontend | {1-5} | {1-5} | {diff} |
| Backend | {1-5} | {1-5} | {diff} |
| Design | {1-5} | {1-5} | {diff} |
| Data/ML | {1-5} | {1-5} | {diff} |
| Marketing | {1-5} | {1-5} | {diff} |
| Sales | {1-5} | {1-5} | {diff} |
| Domain | {1-5} | {1-5} | {diff} |

**Skill levels:**
- 1 = No experience
- 2 = Basic understanding
- 3 = Can build with AI assistance
- 4 = Comfortable, have done before
- 5 = Expert, could teach others

**Gap assessment:**
- Gap ≤ 1: Manageable with AI tools
- Gap = 2: Will slow you down, consider learning or hiring
- Gap ≥ 3: Significant blocker, may need partner or different idea

### 2. Domain Fit

**Questions to answer:**

| Question | Your Answer | Fit Score |
|----------|-------------|-----------|
| Have you experienced this problem personally? | {Yes/No/Somewhat} | {+2/0/+1} |
| Do you have contacts in this space? | {Yes/No/Some} | {+1/0/+0.5} |
| Do you understand the jargon? | {Yes/No/Learning} | {+1/-1/0} |
| Have you worked in this industry? | {Yes/No/Adjacent} | {+2/0/+1} |
| Do you have credibility in this space? | {Yes/No/Building} | {+1/0/0} |

**Domain expertise levels:**

| Level | Description | Advantage |
|-------|-------------|-----------|
| **Insider** | Worked in industry, deep network | Know hidden problems, have distribution |
| **Adjacent** | Related experience, some contacts | Can learn fast, some credibility |
| **Enthusiast** | Personal user/hobbyist | Genuine interest, user empathy |
| **Outsider** | No connection to space | Fresh perspective, but harder to validate |

### 3. Resource Fit

**What you have vs what you need:**

| Resource | Available | Required | Gap |
|----------|-----------|----------|-----|
| Time (hrs/week) | {X} | {Y} | {diff} |
| Runway (months) | {X} | {Y} | {diff} |
| Capital ($) | {X} | {Y} | {diff} |
| Tools/subscriptions | {list} | {list} | {missing} |

**Time reality check:**
- Side project (10-15 hrs/week): 6-12 months to meaningful traction
- Part-time (20-30 hrs/week): 3-6 months to meaningful traction
- Full-time (40+ hrs/week): 1-3 months to meaningful traction

**Runway reality check:**
- Validation phase: 1-2 months
- MVP build: 1-3 months
- Initial traction: 2-4 months
- **Minimum recommended:** 6 months runway if full-time

### 4. Motivation Fit

**Why do you want to build this?**

| Motivation | Sustainability | Score |
|------------|----------------|-------|
| "I have this problem and it drives me crazy" | High | +2 |
| "I see a huge market opportunity" | Medium | +1 |
| "I want to learn these skills" | Low-Medium | 0 |
| "This seems like it would make money" | Low | -1 |
| "Someone told me to build this" | Very Low | -2 |

**Motivation sustainability:**
- High: Will push through hard times
- Medium: May struggle when difficult
- Low: Likely to abandon when shiny object appears

### 5. Timing Fit

**Is now the right time for YOU?**

| Factor | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| Current job situation | {Stable/Transitioning/Flexible} |
| Family obligations | {High/Medium/Low demand} |
| Financial pressure | {High/Medium/Low} |
| Energy levels | {High/Recovery/Low} |
| Other commitments | {Heavy/Manageable/Light} |

**Timing assessment:**
- All green: Go for it
- Mixed: Proceed carefully, set boundaries
- Mostly yellow/red: Consider waiting or reducing scope
