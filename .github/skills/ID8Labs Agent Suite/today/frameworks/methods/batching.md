# Batching

## Overview

Batching groups similar tasks together and completes them in a single focused session. Instead of answering emails throughout the day, batch them to two 30-minute blocks. Instead of making calls whenever needed, batch them to one afternoon hour.

---

## The Core Principle

**Context switching is expensive.**

Every time you switch tasks:
- Lose 15-25 minutes of focus
- Mental residue from previous task
- Setup time for new task
- Increased error rate

Batching minimizes switches by grouping similar work.

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Repetitive tasks (email, calls, admin)
- Similar task types (all writing, all reviews)
- Low-cognitive tasks
- Admin-heavy days
- Reducing interruptions

**Not ideal for:**
- Deep creative work (doesn't need batching)
- Time-sensitive items (can't wait)
- Tasks requiring different contexts

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Identify Batch-able Tasks
Look for tasks that:
- Are similar in nature
- Use the same tools/context
- Can be done together
- Don't need individual scheduling

### Step 2: Group into Batches
Common batches:
- All email
- All calls
- All admin
- All reviews
- All writing
- All errands

### Step 3: Schedule Batch Times
Assign specific time blocks:
- Email: 9am and 3pm (30 min each)
- Calls: 2-3pm
- Admin: Friday afternoon

### Step 4: Batch Process
During batch time:
- Do only batch-type tasks
- Don't switch to other work
- Complete the entire batch
- Move on when done

## Email Batching Deep Dive

### The Problem
Constant email checking:
- Interrupts every 5-10 minutes
- Creates reactive mode
- Kills deep work

### The Solution
**Two batches per day:**
- Morning: 9-9:30am
- Afternoon: 3-3:30pm

### Process
1. Close email outside batch times
2. Turn off notifications
3. During batch: Process inbox to zero
4. After batch: Close email until next batch

### Communication
Set expectations:
- "I check email twice daily"
- "Urgent? Call or text me"
- Auto-responder if needed

## Task Batching Examples

### Writing Day
Instead of writing scattered throughout week:
```
Tuesday Afternoon: Writing Batch
- Draft blog post
- Write newsletter
- Prepare presentation notes
- Document meeting notes
```

### Review Day
Instead of reviewing as things come:
```
Thursday Morning: Review Batch
- Code review queue
- Document review queue
- Proposal feedback
- Team submissions
```

### Operations Day
Instead of admin scattered daily:
```
Friday Afternoon: Ops Batch
- All invoices
- Expense reports
- Calendar cleanup
- Tool updates
```

---

## Batch Processing Flow

```
START BATCH
    ↓
Set timer for batch duration
    ↓
Pull all batch-type tasks
    ↓
Process sequentially (no switching)
    ↓
If complete early: Stop or pull more
    ↓
If time up: Stop, schedule overflow
    ↓
END BATCH
    ↓
Switch to different work
```

## Combining with Other Methods

### Batching + Time Blocking
Each batch is a time block:
- 9-9:30: Email batch
- 9:30-12: Deep work block
- 12-1: Lunch
- 1-2: Meeting batch
- 2-4: Deep work block
- 4-4:30: Admin batch

### Batching + Energy Mapping
Low-energy batches when low energy:
- Afternoon slump: Email batch
- Morning peak: No batching, deep work
- End of day: Admin batch

### Batching + Two-Minute Rule
During batch, apply two-minute rule within the batch type:
- Processing email
- Quick email? Answer now
- Complex email? Flag for later

## Pitfalls

### 1. Too-Long Batches
3-hour email batch = exhausting
**Fix:** Keep batches 30-90 minutes max.

### 2. Urgent Items Can't Wait
Everything feels urgent.
**Fix:** Define true urgency. Most can wait 4 hours.

### 3. Batch Creep
Email batch becomes 2 hours.
**Fix:** Set timer. Stop when it rings.

### 4. Ignoring Batches
Not actually doing the batch.
**Fix:** Treat batch times as meetings. Non-negotiable.

### 5. Too Many Batches
Every hour is a different batch.
**Fix:** 2-4 batches per day max. Group more.
