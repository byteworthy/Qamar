# Eat the Frog

## Overview

"Eat a live frog first thing in the morning, and nothing worse will happen to you the rest of the day." — often attributed to Mark Twain

The method: identify your most important, most difficult, or most dreaded task—and do it first. Before email, before meetings, before easier tasks. The frog.

## The Core Principle

Your willpower and focus are highest in the morning. If you spend that energy on easy tasks, you'll have none left for the hard ones. So flip it: hard first.

**The frog is:**
- Your biggest, most important task
- OR the one you're most likely to procrastinate
- OR the one that will have the most impact

One frog per day. Maybe two if they're medium-sized.

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- High resistance days (you're avoiding something)
- Important tasks that keep getting pushed
- Light task days (focus on depth)
- Building momentum for the week (Monday frogs)

**Not ideal for:**
- Admin-heavy days (no clear frog)
- Days with morning commitments (no frog time)
- Heavy volume days (too many frogs)

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Identify the Frog (Tonight or Morning)

Ask yourself:
- "If I could only accomplish one thing today, what would it be?"
- "What am I most likely to put off?"
- "What task would make the biggest difference?"

That's your frog.

### Step 2: Prepare the Frog
Before bed or first thing:
- Have everything ready to start
- Know the first action
- Remove obstacles

### Step 3: Eat the Frog First
Morning routine:
1. Wake up
2. Brief morning ritual (coffee, not email)
3. Immediately start the frog
4. No checking email, messages, or news first
5. Work until the frog is done (or significant progress)

### Step 4: Celebrate
Once the frog is eaten:
- Feel the relief
- The rest of the day is easier
- You've already won

## Identifying Your Frog

### The Impact Frog
The task that moves things forward most.
- Shipping a feature
- Closing a deal
- Finishing a deliverable

### The Avoidance Frog
The task you've been putting off.
- That difficult conversation
- The report you've delayed
- The decision you're avoiding

### The Important Frog
The non-urgent but crucial task.
- Strategic planning
- Relationship building
- Skill development

### Multiple Frogs?
If you have two frogs, eat the ugliest one first.
If you have more than two, some are tadpoles—they can wait.

## Morning Frog Protocol

```
5:00-6:00  Wake, basic routine (no phone)
6:00-6:15  Review the frog, set up
6:15-8:00  EAT THE FROG (protect this time)
8:00+      Everything else is easier
```

Adjust times to your schedule, but the principle holds: frog first.

## Frog Variations

One major frog for the week, broken into daily chunks.

For lower-resistance days, pick a medium task.

### Frog + Reward
Eat the frog, then allow yourself something enjoyable.

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### Frog + Pomodoro
Eat the frog in pomodoros:
- 2-4 pomodoros dedicated to the frog
- Short breaks built in
- Completion celebrated

### Frog + Time Blocking
Block your first 2 hours for frog time. Non-negotiable.

### Frog + Eisenhower
Your frog should come from Q1 or Q2 (important tasks).

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Too Many Frogs
Everything feels like a frog.
**Fix:** One frog max. Two if they're small. The rest are tadpoles.

### 2. Email First "Just to Check"
Checking email before the frog kills frog time.
**Fix:** No email until after the frog. Put phone away.

### 3. Frog Too Big
The frog is a 3-day project, not a morning task.
**Fix:** Slice the frog. What's the first 2-hour chunk?

### 4. No Clear Frog
Can't identify which task is the frog.
**Fix:** Ask "What am I avoiding?" That's probably it.

### 5. Not Actually Eating
Staring at the frog instead of biting.
**Fix:** Define the very first action. Do that action.
