# Ivy Lee Method

## Overview

In 1918, productivity consultant Ivy Lee gave steel magnate Charles Schwab a simple method. Schwab's executives used it for three months, then Schwab paid Lee $25,000 (worth ~$500,000 today) because it was "the most profitable lesson he had ever learned."

The method: six tasks, ranked, done in order.

## The Method

### Every Evening:
1. Write down the six most important tasks for tomorrow
2. Rank them in order of importance (1-6)
3. Stop. Don't add more.

### Every Morning:
1. Start with task #1
2. Work on it until complete
3. Move to task #2
4. Continue through the list
5. Move unfinished tasks to tomorrow's list

That's it.

## Why It Works

### Simplicity
No complex systems, no apps, no categories. Just six tasks and an order.

### Decision Limitation
Choosing six forces prioritization. You can't do everything, so you must choose what matters.

### Single Focus
Work on one task at a time. No multitasking, no switching.

### Clear Start
You always know what to do next—the next item on the list.

### Momentum
Completing tasks builds momentum. Order matters.

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Light to medium task days
- When you need simplicity
- Breaking analysis paralysis
- Building productivity habits
- Focus on what matters most

**Not ideal for:**
- Very heavy task days (>10 items)
- Highly reactive days
- When tasks have time constraints
- Complex project management

---

## How to Apply

### Evening (5 minutes)

**Step 1: Brain dump**
List everything you could do tomorrow.

**Step 2: Select six**
Choose the six most important. Ask:
- "What will have the most impact?"
- "What must get done?"
- "What would I regret not doing?"

**Step 3: Rank 1-6**
Put them in order. #1 is most important.
- If everything feels equally important, use your gut
- The ranking forces the decision

**Step 4: Stop**
Don't add a seventh. Six is the limit.

### Morning

**Step 1: Start #1**
Open your list. Start task #1 immediately.

**Step 2: Complete or Progress**
Work until #1 is done. If it's too big:
- Work on it until you can't anymore
- It stays at #1 for tomorrow

**Step 3: Move through the list**
After #1, start #2. After #2, start #3.
Continue until done or day ends.

**Step 4: Roll forward**
Any incomplete tasks become tomorrow's priorities.

## Selecting Your Six

### The Filter Questions

1. **Impact:** What moves things forward most?
2. **Urgency:** What has real deadlines?
3. **Resistance:** What am I avoiding that I shouldn't?
4. **Dependencies:** What unblocks other work?
5. **Energy:** What fits tomorrow's energy?

### Balance Considerations

Not all six should be:
- Huge tasks (exhausting)
- Tiny tasks (not moving forward)
- Same domain (life needs variety)

A balanced six:
- 1-2 big important tasks
- 2-3 medium tasks
- 1-2 smaller/maintenance tasks

---

## Ranking the Six

### Method 1: Forced Ranking
Compare each to the others:
- "Is A more important than B?"
- Work through until you have an order

### Method 2: Time Sensitivity
Rank by deadline proximity.

### Method 3: Impact First
Rank by potential impact, regardless of urgency.

### Method 4: Energy Matching
Rank by fitting your energy pattern:
- High-energy morning → hardest tasks first
- Low-energy afternoon → easier tasks later

---

## What If I Don't Finish?

### Less Than Six Complete
Normal. Roll incomplete tasks to tomorrow.

### Only One Complete
That's okay. You did the most important thing.

### Zero Complete
Examine why:
- Were tasks too big? Break them down.
- Too many interruptions? Protect time.
- Wrong tasks? Choose more actionable items.

### All Six Complete
Great! Either:
- You're done for the day, or
- Add remaining items (but don't exceed six new ones)

---

## Variations

### The Core Five
Five tasks instead of six. Even simpler.

### Ivy Lee + Time Estimates
Add time estimates to each task.
Still six tasks, but know how long they'll take.

### Ivy Lee + Domain Tags
Tag each task by domain (ID8/TV/Life).
Ensure domain balance.

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### Ivy Lee + Eat the Frog
#1 is always the frog. Hardest, most important first.

### Ivy Lee + Time Blocking
Block time for each of the six tasks in order.

### Ivy Lee + Pomodoro
Estimate each task in pomodoros.
Work through the six using pomodoro rhythm.

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. More Than Six
Adding "just one more."
**Fix:** Strict limit. Six is six. Move extras to tomorrow.

### 2. Six Huge Tasks
All tasks are 3+ hours.
**Fix:** Break down big tasks. Six should be completable.

### 3. Skipping to Easier Tasks
Doing #4 before #1 because it's easier.
**Fix:** Order matters. Do #1 first. That's the rule.

### 4. No Evening Prep
Choosing tasks in the morning.
**Fix:** Evening prep essential. Wake up knowing your six.

### 5. Guilt About Incomplete
Not finishing all six feels like failure.
**Fix:** Completing #1 is a win. The rest is bonus.

## Process Template

```markdown
## Ivy Lee: {date}

### Tomorrow's Six

| # | Task | Est Time | Domain |
|---|------|----------|--------|
| 1 | {most important} | {time} | {domain} |
| 2 | {second} | {time} | {domain} |
| 3 | {third} | {time} | {domain} |
| 4 | {fourth} | {time} | {domain} |
| 5 | {fifth} | {time} | {domain} |
| 6 | {sixth} | {time} | {domain} |

### Notes
- #1 is the priority. Everything else is secondary.
- Work in order. No skipping.
- Incomplete tasks roll to tomorrow.
