# Time Blocking

## Overview

Time blocking assigns every hour of your day to a specific task or category of work. Instead of a to-do list you react to, you have a schedule you follow.

Cal Newport, author of "Deep Work," advocates time blocking as the key to focused, meaningful work in a distracted world.

## The Core Principle

Your calendar is your to-do list. If it's not on the calendar, it doesn't happen. Time blocking forces decisions about what actually gets time.

**The shift:**
- From: "I have these tasks, I'll do them when I can"
- To: "This task happens at 9am, this one at 11am"

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Deep work and focus tasks
- Protecting time from interruptions
- Full control of your day
- Creative work requiring extended focus
- Days with mixed task types

**Not ideal for:**
- Highly reactive roles
- Days with many unknowns
- Very light task days
- When flexibility is essential

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: List Tomorrow's Tasks (5 min)
Write down everything you need to accomplish.

### Step 2: Estimate Time
Assign realistic time estimates to each.
- Add 20-50% buffer to estimates
- You always underestimate

### Step 3: Create Blocks (5 min)
Assign tasks to specific time slots.

**Block types:**
- **Deep Work:** 90-120 min for focused tasks
- **Shallow Work:** 30-60 min for admin
- **Buffer:** 30 min between blocks for overflow
- **Recovery:** Breaks, lunch, reset time

### Step 4: Follow the Schedule
When the block starts, do that task. When it ends, move on.

### Step 5: Adjust as Needed
Reality happens. When interrupted:
- Adjust remaining blocks
- Don't throw away the whole day
- Reblock for the afternoon

## Daily Template

```
6:00 - 7:00   Morning routine (protected)
7:00 - 9:00   DEEP WORK: {high-priority task}
9:00 - 9:30   Buffer/email
9:30 - 11:00  DEEP WORK: {second priority}
11:00 - 12:00 Shallow work: {admin batch}
12:00 - 1:00  LUNCH (protected)
1:00 - 2:00   Meetings/calls
2:00 - 3:30   DEEP WORK: {afternoon focus}
3:30 - 4:00   Buffer/email
4:00 - 5:00   Shallow work: {wrap-up tasks}
5:00 - 5:30   Planning tomorrow
```

## Block Types

### Deep Work Blocks
- 90-120 minutes minimum
- One task only
- No interruptions allowed
- Notifications off
- Phone away

### Shallow Work Blocks
- 30-60 minutes
- Admin, email, small tasks
- Batch similar items
- Accept some interruption

### Buffer Blocks
- 15-30 minutes
- Between major blocks
- Handle overflow
- Process quick items
- Reset for next block

### Meeting Blocks
- Consolidated when possible
- Not scattered throughout
- Protected deep work around them

### Protected Time
- Lunch, breaks, end of day
- Non-negotiable
- Recovery matters

## Theming Blocks

### By Task Type
- Morning: Creative/generative work
- Midday: Collaborative/meetings
- Afternoon: Administrative/routine

### By Energy
- High energy times: Hardest tasks
- Low energy times: Easy tasks
- Match blocks to your rhythms

### By Domain
- 9-12: ID8 Projects
- 1-3: TV Production
- 3-5: Admin/Life

---

## Handling Interruptions

### Planned Interruptions
- Schedule buffer blocks
- Have "office hours" for questions
- Communicate your blocks to others

### Unplanned Interruptions
1. Assess: Is this truly urgent?
2. If yes: Handle it, then reblock
3. If no: "Can this wait until my 3pm buffer?"

### Block Overflow
When a task runs longer:
- Extend into buffer if available
- Otherwise, stop and continue tomorrow
- Don't blow up the whole day

---

## Weekly Time Blocking

### Theme Days
Assign focus areas to days:
- Monday: Planning + Deep Work
- Tuesday: Meetings + Collaboration
- Wednesday: Deep Work
- Thursday: External + Calls
- Friday: Admin + Review

### Recurring Blocks
Set weekly:
- Same deep work times each day
- Same admin times
- Same planning times
- Creates rhythm

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### Time Blocking + Pomodoro
Use pomodoros within deep work blocks:
- 2-hour block = 4 pomodoros
- Built-in breaks
- Track progress

### Time Blocking + Eat the Frog
First deep work block = frog time.

### Time Blocking + Eisenhower
- Q1 tasks: Get blocks first
- Q2 tasks: Protected deep work blocks
- Q3 tasks: Batch into shallow blocks

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Over-scheduling
No buffer, no breaks, every minute planned.
**Fix:** 30% buffer minimum. You need slack.

### 2. Unrealistic Estimates
Tasks take longer than you think.
**Fix:** Add 50% to your estimates. Always.

### 3. Inflexibility
Treating blocks as sacred when they shouldn't be.
**Fix:** Blocks guide, not prison. Adjust when needed.

### 4. Ignoring Energy
Deep work when you're exhausted.
**Fix:** Match blocks to energy patterns.

### 5. No Review
Planning blocks but not reviewing outcomes.
**Fix:** End each day assessing what worked.
