# GTD (Getting Things Done)

## Overview

Getting Things Done (GTD) is David Allen's comprehensive productivity system. The core idea: your brain is for having ideas, not holding them. Capture everything externally, process systematically, and trust your system.

---

## The Five Steps

```
CAPTURE → CLARIFY → ORGANIZE → REFLECT → ENGAGE
```

### 1. Capture
Get everything out of your head into a trusted external system.

### 2. Clarify
Process what you've captured: Is it actionable? What's the next action?

### 3. Organize
Put items where they belong: calendar, next actions, projects, someday/maybe.

### 4. Reflect
Regular reviews to keep the system current and trusted.

### 5. Engage
Actually do the work, choosing based on context.

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Overwhelm (too many things in your head)
- Heavy task volume
- Multiple active projects
- Feeling scattered or anxious
- Weekly planning

**Not ideal for:**
- Simple days with few tasks
- Already clear on priorities
- When you need to just execute

## How to Apply

### Full GTD Capture (15 minutes)

**Step 1: Brain Dump (5 minutes)**
Write down EVERYTHING on your mind:
- Tasks you need to do
- Projects you're working on
- Ideas you've had
- Worries and concerns
- Commitments you've made
- Things you're waiting on

Don't organize—just capture.

**Step 2: Process Each Item (5 minutes)**

For each item, ask:
1. "Is this actionable?"
   - No → Reference, Someday/Maybe, or Trash
   - Yes → Continue

2. "What's the next physical action?"
   - Define concrete next step
   - If <2 minutes → Do it now

3. "Is this a one-step task or a project?"
   - One step → Add to Next Actions
   - Multiple steps → Add to Projects list

4. "When/where can I do this?"
   - Add context (@computer, @calls, @errands)

**Step 3: Organize (5 minutes)**

Place items in appropriate lists:
- **Calendar:** Time-specific actions
- **Next Actions:** Available tasks by context
- **Projects:** Multi-step outcomes
- **Waiting For:** Delegated or pending items
- **Someday/Maybe:** Future possibilities

---

## GTD Lists

### Next Actions
Concrete next steps you can take now.
Organized by context:
- @computer
- @phone
- @errands
- @home
- @office
- @anywhere

### Projects
Any outcome requiring more than one action step.
Each project needs at least one Next Action defined.

### Waiting For
Items delegated to others or pending external input.
Include who and when expected.

### Someday/Maybe
Things you might want to do but not committed to.
Review regularly to activate or delete.

### Reference
Information you might need but isn't actionable.

---

## The Two-Minute Rule

If an action takes less than two minutes, do it immediately during processing. Adding it to a list takes longer than doing it.

---

## Weekly Review

The key to making GTD work:

1. **Get Clear** (15 min)
   - Empty all inboxes
   - Process all captured items
   - Clear your head

2. **Get Current** (10 min)
   - Review Next Actions
   - Review Projects (each has next action?)
   - Review Waiting For
   - Review Calendar

3. **Get Creative** (5 min)
   - Review Someday/Maybe
   - Capture new ideas
   - Think strategically

## ID8TODAY GTD Adaptation

### Quick GTD (Daily)
Lighter version for daily use:

1. **Capture** (2 min)
   - Empty parking lot into inbox
   - Add any floating thoughts

2. **Clarify** (3 min)
   - Process inbox items
   - Define next actions
   - Apply two-minute rule

3. **Organize** (2 min)
   - Assign to today/tomorrow/later
   - Tag with context

### Full GTD (Weekly)
Complete review during weekly planning.

---

## Context Tags

Use contexts to filter tasks by where/when you can do them:

| Context | Symbol | When Available |
|---------|--------|----------------|
| @computer | @c | At desk with computer |
| @phone | @p | Can make calls |
| @errands | @e | Out of house |
| @home | @h | At home |
| @focus | @f | Need deep focus |
| @low-energy | @- | Can do tired |

Filter by context when choosing what to do next.

---

## Natural Planning Model

For projects, use GTD's natural planning:

1. **Purpose/Principles** - Why doing this?
2. **Outcome Visioning** - What does done look like?
3. **Brainstorming** - What ideas/steps might work?
4. **Organizing** - What's the sequence?
5. **Next Actions** - What's the very next step?

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Over-complicated System
GTD can become bureaucracy.
**Fix:** Start simple. Add complexity only when needed.

### 2. Skipping Weekly Review
System gets stale and loses trust.
**Fix:** Schedule review as recurring appointment.

### 3. Projects Without Next Actions
Stuck projects that never move.
**Fix:** Every project needs at least one Next Action.

### 4. Someday/Maybe Graveyard
Items that never get reviewed or activated.
**Fix:** Review monthly. Delete ruthlessly.

### 5. Not Trusting the System
Keeping things in your head "just in case."
**Fix:** Commit fully or don't use GTD.
