# 1-3-5 Rule

## Overview

The 1-3-5 Rule structures your day around task size: 1 big task, 3 medium tasks, 5 small tasks. This creates realistic expectations while ensuring you tackle something significant.

---

## The Structure

```
1 BIG thing      (1-3 hours, high impact)
3 MEDIUM things  (30-60 min each)
5 SMALL things   (5-15 min each)
```

**Total: 9 tasks**
- Realistic for a full day
- Mix of sizes keeps momentum
- Big thing ensures impact

---

## Why It Works

### Realistic Ambition
Nine tasks feels achievable yet productive. Not too few (lazy), not too many (overwhelmed).

### Forced Prioritization
Only one "big" slot forces you to choose what matters most.

### Size Awareness
Acknowledging task size prevents over-committing.

### Completion Satisfaction
Checking off small wins builds momentum for the big one.

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Mixed task days
- Medium volume workloads
- When you need variety
- Realistic planning
- Building consistent habits

**Not ideal for:**
- Deep work days (one big task is all you need)
- Very light days (overkill)
- Heavy meeting days (no room for 9 tasks)

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: List All Tasks
Brain dump everything for today.

### Step 2: Categorize by Size

**Big tasks (1-3 hours):**
- Requires deep focus
- Significant outcome
- Can't be done in passing

**Medium tasks (30-60 min):**
- Substantial but not huge
- Clear deliverable
- Focused attention needed

**Small tasks (5-15 min):**
- Quick wins
- Admin, email, simple actions
- Can batch together

### Step 3: Select Your 1-3-5

**Choose:**
- 1 big task (the most important)
- 3 medium tasks (next priority)
- 5 small tasks (maintenance/admin)

### Step 4: Execute

Order options:
- **Big first:** Eat the frog style
- **Small first:** Build momentum
- **Mixed:** Alternate for energy

## Size Guidelines

### Big Tasks (1)
Examples:
- Write a major document
- Build a feature
- Complete a deliverable
- Strategic planning session
- Deep creative work

**Characteristics:**
- 1-3 hours
- Requires concentration
- High impact
- Can't be interrupted

### Medium Tasks (3)
Examples:
- Review and feedback
- Meeting prep
- Research a topic
- Draft an email thread
- Update documentation

**Characteristics:**
- 30-60 minutes
- Focused but not exhausting
- Clear completion point
- Moderate impact

### Small Tasks (5)
Examples:
- Reply to an email
- Make a quick call
- Update a status
- Review a document
- Schedule a meeting

**Characteristics:**
- 5-15 minutes
- Low cognitive load
- Quick win
- Can batch together

## Execution Strategies

### Strategy 1: Big First
Do the big task immediately. Protect your morning.
- Pro: Frog eaten, momentum built
- Con: Can feel heavy to start

### Strategy 2: Warm-Up
Do 1-2 small tasks first, then big, then rest.
- Pro: Builds momentum, wakes up brain
- Con: Risk of staying in small mode

### Strategy 3: Sandwich
Small → Big → Medium → Small
- Pro: Varied, maintains energy
- Con: Big task interrupted by others

### Strategy 4: Time-Based
Morning: Big + 1 medium
Afternoon: 2 medium + 5 small
- Pro: Matches energy patterns
- Con: Requires time blocking

---

## Handling Overflow

### Too Many Big Tasks
Only one big slot. Others become:
- Tomorrow's big
- Broken into medium tasks
- Deferred to another day

### Too Many Medium Tasks
Three slots only. Extras:
- Move to small (if smaller than thought)
- Become tomorrow's 1-3
- Get deferred

### Not Enough Tasks
Fill with:
- Q2 important tasks (usually neglected)
- Maintenance/tech debt
- Learning/development

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### 1-3-5 + Time Blocking
Block time for each:
- Big: 9am-12pm
- Medium: 1pm-3pm (1 hour each)
- Small: 3pm-4pm (batched)

### 1-3-5 + Eisenhower
- Big: From Q1 or Q2 (important)
- Medium: Mix of Q1, Q2, Q3
- Small: Often Q3 (urgent but small)

### 1-3-5 + Pomodoro
- Big: 4-6 pomodoros
- Medium: 1-2 pomodoros each
- Small: No pomodoro needed

---

## Variations

### 1-2-3
Lighter version:
- 1 big
- 2 medium
- 3 small
Total: 6 tasks. Good for shorter days.

### 2-3-5
Two big tasks:
- 2 big
- 3 medium
- 5 small
Total: 10 tasks. Ambitious day.

### 0-3-5
No big task:
- 3 medium
- 5 small
For meeting-heavy or admin days.

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Big Task Too Big
"Build entire app" isn't a day's task.
**Fix:** Break into 1-3 hour chunks.

### 2. All Small Tasks
Avoiding the big by doing small.
**Fix:** Big task must be attempted before small.

### 3. Undersized Categories
"Medium" tasks that are really small.
**Fix:** Honest sizing. Small = 15 min max.

### 4. Overcommitting
Doing 1-5-10 instead of 1-3-5.
**Fix:** Stick to the formula. Nine is enough.

### 5. Ignoring Incomplete
Not rolling forward what didn't get done.
**Fix:** Incomplete big → tomorrow's big.

## Process Template

```markdown
## 1-3-5: {date}

### The Big One (1)
- [ ] {task} — Est: {time}

### Medium Tasks (3)

### Time Estimate
- Big: {1-3 hrs}
- Medium: {1.5-3 hrs total}
- Small: {30-60 min total}

## Output Format

```markdown
## Today's 1-3-5: {date}

### 🔴 BIG (1)
- [ ] **{task}**
  Domain: {domain}
  Est: {time}
  First action: {specific step}

### 🟡 MEDIUM (3)

## End of Day Review

```markdown
## 1-3-5 Review: {date}

### Completed
- Big: {0 or 1}/1
- Medium: {n}/3
- Small: {n}/5
- **Total: {n}/9**

### Roll Forward
- Tomorrow's big: {task}
- Carry-over medium: {tasks}

### Reflection
- Was big task sized right? {y/n}
- Did small tasks creep up? {y/n}
