# Two-Minute Rule

## Overview

The Two-Minute Rule from David Allen's GTD: If a task takes less than two minutes, do it immediately. Don't add it to any list—just do it.

The insight: The overhead of tracking a tiny task exceeds the effort of just doing it.

---

## The Rule

**If it takes less than 2 minutes → Do it NOW.**

Don't:
- Write it down
- Add to a list
- Schedule it
- Think about it later

Just do it.

---

## Why Two Minutes

### The Math
- Adding to list: 30 seconds
- Processing later: 30 seconds
- Finding it again: 30 seconds
- Deciding again: 30 seconds
- Actually doing it: 2 minutes
- **Total: 4 minutes**

Just doing it now: **2 minutes**

### The Psychology
- Small tasks clutter your mind
- Long lists create anxiety
- Quick wins build momentum
- Completion feels good

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Inbox processing
- During task review
- Clearing mental clutter
- Building momentum
- Low-energy periods

**Not ideal for:**
- Deep work sessions (too many interruptions)
- When every minute counts
- If "two minutes" keeps expanding

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Encounter a Task
You think of something or receive a request.

### Step 2: Quick Assessment
Ask: "Will this take less than 2 minutes?"
- Yes → Do it immediately
- No → Add to appropriate list

### Step 3: Do It
Complete the task right now.
- Don't overthink
- Don't perfect
- Just done

### Step 4: Move On
No celebration, no logging.
It's done. Next thing.

## Two-Minute Task Examples

### Email
- Reply with quick answer
- Forward to right person
- Archive or delete
- Unsubscribe from list

### Admin
- File a document
- Update a status
- Make a quick note
- Add calendar event

### Communication
- Send quick text
- Confirm attendance
- Quick acknowledgment
- Brief follow-up

### Organization
- Put something away
- Close browser tabs
- Clear notification
- Update a field

---

## Variations

### One-Minute Rule
Stricter version. If <1 minute, do immediately.
Good for very busy days.

### Five-Minute Rule
Looser version. If <5 minutes, do immediately.
Good for clearing bigger backlogs.

### Context-Based
- During inbox processing: 2 minutes
- During deep work: 0 minutes (defer everything)
- During admin time: 5 minutes

---

## Two-Minute Batching

### The Anti-Pattern
Using two-minute rule during deep work = constant interruption.

### The Solution
Collect two-minute tasks, batch them:
- Capture during work
- Process in dedicated "two-minute sweep"
- 15 minutes of rapid-fire completion

### Two-Minute Sweep
Every few hours, run through collected quick tasks:
```
1. Open quick task list
2. Timer: 15 minutes
3. Do as many as possible
4. Stop when timer rings
5. Continue with real work
```

---

## When NOT to Use

### During Deep Work
Don't interrupt focus for any task.
Capture and process later.

### When It's Actually 10 Minutes
Be honest. "Two minutes" can creep.
If it's really more, add it to a list.

### When You're Avoiding Big Tasks
If you're doing 20 two-minute tasks instead of one big one, that's procrastination disguised as productivity.

### When Quality Matters
Some quick tasks deserve more thought.
Don't rush important things.

---

## The Expansion Trap

### How It Happens
1. "Two minutes" becomes "just five more"
2. Quick task leads to rabbit hole
3. 20 minutes later, you're still on "two-minute" task

### Prevention
- Set actual timer for complex "quick" tasks
- Define done before starting
- If it expands, stop and schedule properly

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### Two-Minute + GTD
Core part of GTD inbox processing:
- Processing inbox item
- Is it actionable?
- Can it be done in 2 minutes?
- Yes → Do it now
- No → Process further

### Two-Minute + Must-Should-Could
Two-minute tasks don't need categorizing.
They're done before you'd file them.

### Two-Minute + Energy Mapping
Great for low-energy periods:
- Too tired for deep work
- But can do two-minute tasks
- Build momentum with quick wins

## Pitfalls

### 1. Everything Becomes Two Minutes
Underestimating task duration.
**Fix:** Actually time your "two-minute" tasks. Calibrate.

### 2. Two-Minute Procrastination
Doing easy quick tasks to avoid hard ones.
**Fix:** Check if you're avoiding. Do hard thing first.

### 3. Context Switch Overload
Switching to every micro-task.
**Fix:** Batch two-minute tasks. Don't interrupt deep work.

### 4. Perfectionism
Making two-minute tasks take ten.
**Fix:** Good enough for quick tasks. Move on.

### 5. Missing the Point
Logging two-minute tasks in elaborate system.
**Fix:** The point is NOT to track them. Just do them.

## Process Template

### During Inbox Processing

```markdown
## Quick Wins Processed

### Done Immediately (2-min rule)
- ✓ {quick task}
- ✓ {quick task}
- ✓ {quick task}

### Added to Lists (needs more time)
- {task} → Today
- {task} → Tomorrow
- {task} → Project list

### Time Saved
- Quick tasks done: {count}
- Est. if tracked: {count × 4 min}
- Actual time: {count × 2 min}
```

### Two-Minute Sweep

```markdown
## Two-Minute Sweep: {time}

### Timer: 15 minutes
### Tasks cleared:
- ✓ {task}
- ✓ {task}
- ✓ {task}
- ✓ {task}
- ✓ {task}

### Total: {count} tasks in {minutes} minutes
### Average: {seconds} per task
```

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## Two-Minute Check: {task}

**Task:** {description}
**Estimated time:** {X minutes}

**Verdict:** {DO NOW / ADD TO LIST}

{If DO NOW}
→ Doing it now. Done.

{If ADD TO LIST}
→ Adding to {list name}
→ Why: Takes more than 2 minutes / needs more thought
```

---

## Quick Reference

```
Is it actionable?
  → No: Trash/Reference/Someday
  → Yes: Continue

Will it take <2 minutes?
  → Yes: DO IT NOW
  → No: What's the next action? → Add to list

After doing:
  → Don't log it
  → Don't celebrate
  → Move on
```
