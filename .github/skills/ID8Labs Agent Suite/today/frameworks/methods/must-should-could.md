# Must-Should-Could (MoSCoW)

## Overview

Must-Should-Could is a simple three-tier prioritization method. Originally from software development (MoSCoW: Must, Should, Could, Won't), this simplified version helps quickly triage tasks when you're overwhelmed.

---

## The Three Tiers

### MUST Do
Non-negotiable. Failure or serious consequences if not done today.
- Hard deadlines
- Commitments to others
- Critical blockers
- Can't be rescheduled

### SHOULD Do
Important and valuable, but can technically wait.
- High impact work
- Moves goals forward
- Professional obligations
- Ideally done today, survivable if not

### COULD Do
Nice to have. Only if time permits.
- Improvements
- Nice-to-haves
- Low-stakes items
- First to cut if overwhelmed

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Overwhelm (too many things feel urgent)
- Quick triage
- Heavy task volume
- Decision paralysis
- Days with real constraints

**Not ideal for:**
- Light task days (overkill)
- When everything genuinely is MUST
- Long-term planning

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: List All Tasks (2 min)
Quick brain dump of everything on your plate.

### Step 2: MUST Filter (1 min)
For each task, ask:
- "What actually happens if this doesn't get done today?"
- If serious consequences → MUST
- If inconvenient but survivable → SHOULD or COULD

### Step 3: SHOULD Filter (1 min)
Of remaining tasks:
- "Is this important and valuable today?"
- Yes → SHOULD
- Nice to have → COULD

### Step 4: Execute (ongoing)
1. Do all MUSTs first
2. If time, do SHOULDs
3. If still time, do COULDs
4. COULDs move to tomorrow if not done

---

## The Hard Truth About MUST

**Real MUSTs are rare.**

Most things feel urgent but aren't. True MUSTs have:
- Hard deadlines (not soft, not "would be nice")
- Real consequences (not just discomfort)
- External commitments (someone genuinely waiting)
- No alternative timing (truly today only)

If you have more than 3 MUSTs, recheck. Some are SHOULDs in disguise.

---

## MUST Criteria Checklist

Ask for each potential MUST:

| Question | Yes = MUST | No = SHOULD/COULD |
|----------|------------|-------------------|
| Is there a hard deadline today? | ✓ | → SHOULD |
| Is someone actively waiting? | ✓ | → SHOULD |
| Are there real consequences if delayed? | ✓ | → SHOULD |
| Is it truly impossible tomorrow? | ✓ | → SHOULD |

Must answer YES to at least one to be a real MUST.

---

## SHOULD vs COULD

### SHOULD
- Important to your goals
- Valuable if completed
- Would regret not doing it
- Professional impact

### COULD
- Nice to have
- Incremental improvements
- Low stakes
- First to defer

**The test:** "Would I be disappointed if this didn't happen today?"
- Yes → SHOULD
- No → COULD

## Processing Template

```markdown
## Must-Should-Could: {date}

### MUST (Non-negotiable today)
- [ ] {task} — Why: {consequence if not done}
- [ ] {task} — Why: {consequence}
- [ ] {task} — Why: {consequence}

### SHOULD (Important, do if possible)
- [ ] {task}
- [ ] {task}
- [ ] {task}

### COULD (Nice to have)
- [ ] {task}
- [ ] {task}
- [ ] {task}

---

### Reality Check
- MUST count: {n} (should be ≤3)
- Total estimated time: {hours}
- Available time: {hours}
- Fits? {y/n}
```

---

## When Everything Feels MUST

### Step 1: External vs Internal
Separate tasks by who imposed them:
- External (deadline from client, boss, etc.)
- Internal (self-imposed "urgency")

External MUSTs are more likely real.

### Step 2: Consequence Test
For each "MUST," visualize not doing it:
- What actually happens?
- Is it truly serious?
- Can it be recovered tomorrow?

### Step 3: Negotiate
If too many real MUSTs:
- Communicate constraints
- Negotiate deadlines
- Reduce scope
- Ask for help

### Step 4: Accept
Some days have too many MUSTs. Accept it, do your best, protect tomorrow.

---

## Execution Order

### Option 1: MUSTs First (Recommended)
Do all MUSTs before any SHOULDs.
- Pro: Non-negotiables done
- Con: May feel heavy

### Option 2: Quick SHOULD First
One quick SHOULD to build momentum, then MUSTs.
- Pro: Gets moving
- Con: Risk of avoidance

### Option 3: Interleaved
MUST, SHOULD, MUST, COULD pattern.
- Pro: Varied energy
- Con: Risk of not finishing MUSTs

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### MSC + Time Blocking
- Morning: MUSTs blocked
- Afternoon: SHOULDs blocked
- End of day: COULDs (if time)

### MSC + Eisenhower
- MUST = Q1 (Urgent + Important)
- SHOULD = Q2 (Important)
- COULD = Q3/Q4

### MSC + 1-3-5
- MUST = The "1" big task
- SHOULD = The "3" medium tasks
- COULD = The "5" small tasks

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Too Many MUSTs
Everything feels non-negotiable.
**Fix:** Use consequence test ruthlessly. Most aren't real MUSTs.

### 2. Ignoring SHOULDs
Only doing MUSTs, never getting to important work.
**Fix:** If day is all MUSTs, something is wrong. Fix the system.

### 3. COULD Guilt
Feeling bad about not doing COULDs.
**Fix:** COULDs are optional by definition. No guilt.

### 4. No Triage Time
Skipping the categorization step.
**Fix:** Take 3 minutes. The sorting saves hours.

### 5. Static Categories
Task stays MUST even when context changes.
**Fix:** Re-triage if circumstances shift.

---

## Variations

### MoSCoW Full (Won't)
Add a fourth category:
- **Won't** — Explicitly not doing today
This makes the "no" explicit.

### MUST + Everything Else
Binary version:
- MUST (max 3)
- Everything else
Simpler when overwhelmed.

### Time-Boxed MSC
- MUSTs by 12pm
- SHOULDs by 4pm
- COULDs by 6pm

---

## Output Format

```markdown
## Today's Priorities: {date}

### 🔴 MUST (Do these)
| Task | Deadline | Consequence |
|------|----------|-------------|
| {task} | {time} | {what happens if not done} |
| {task} | {time} | {consequence} |

### 🟡 SHOULD (If time permits)
- [ ] {task}
- [ ] {task}
- [ ] {task}

### 🟢 COULD (Nice to have)
- [ ] {task}
- [ ] {task}

### ❌ WON'T (Explicitly deferred)
- {task} → {when instead}

---

**Start with:** First MUST
**MUSTs done by:** {target time}
```

## Quick Triage Script

When overwhelmed, run this:

```
1. List everything (2 min)
2. For each: "Real consequence if not today?"
   - Yes → MUST
   - No → SHOULD or COULD
3. Count MUSTs
   - >3? Re-evaluate. Some are SHOULDs.
4. Time check
   - Do MUSTs fit? If not, negotiate.
5. Execute MUSTs first
6. SHOULDs next
7. COULDs if lucky
```
