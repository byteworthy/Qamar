# Weekly Themes

## Overview

Weekly Themes assigns a focus area to each day of the week. Instead of juggling all responsibilities daily, you dedicate specific days to specific types of work. Reduces context switching and creates predictable rhythms.

---

## The Core Principle

**Batching by day, not by hour.**

Instead of:
- Monday: Meeting + code + admin + content + code
- Tuesday: Admin + meeting + code + content + code

Try:
- Monday: All meetings and collaboration
- Tuesday: All deep coding work
- Wednesday: Content and marketing
- Thursday: External calls and networking
- Friday: Admin and planning

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Multiple domains (ID8 + TV + Life)
- Varied work types
- Reducing daily context switching
- Creating predictable schedules
- Team coordination

**Not ideal for:**
- Highly reactive roles
- Days with fixed external schedules
- When flexibility is required
- Short-term crisis mode

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: List Your Work Types
Categories of work you do:
- Deep work / Building
- Meetings / Collaboration
- Admin / Operations
- Content / Marketing
- External / Networking
- Planning / Strategy
- Learning / Development

### Step 2: Assign to Days
Match work types to days:
- Consider energy patterns (Monday vs Friday)
- Group similar activities
- Respect external constraints (regular meetings)

### Step 3: Communicate
Tell relevant people your themes:
- "Tuesdays are my deep work days"
- "I take calls on Thursdays"

### Step 4: Protect the Theme
Defend each day's focus:
- Move off-theme requests to appropriate days
- Accept some exceptions but keep them rare

## Theme Assignment Principles

### Monday: Momentum
Often best for:
- Planning and organizing
- Team alignment
- Setting weekly goals
- Medium-energy work

Avoid: Deep creative work (weekend recovery)

### Tuesday-Wednesday: Peak Days
Often best for:
- Deepest work
- Hardest tasks
- Creative projects
- Maximum focus

Protect these days fiercely.

### Thursday: External
Often best for:
- Calls and meetings
- Collaboration
- External relationships
- Partnership work

### Friday: Wind-Down
Often best for:
- Admin and cleanup
- Weekly review
- Planning next week
- Lighter work

## Example Theme Structures

### Creator Schedule
```
Monday: Planning + Admin
Tuesday: Deep Work (building)
Wednesday: Deep Work (building)
Thursday: Collaboration + Calls
Friday: Content + Review
```

### Mixed Role Schedule
```
Monday: Team + Meetings
Tuesday: Deep Work
Wednesday: External + Calls
Thursday: Deep Work
Friday: Admin + Planning
```

### ID8Labs + TV Production
```
Monday: ID8 - Planning + Strategy
Tuesday: ID8 - Building
Wednesday: TV - Production work
Thursday: TV - Calls + Coordination
Friday: Mixed - Admin + Review
```

---

## Domain-Day Mapping

For managing ID8 + TV + Life:

### Full Separation
```
Monday: ID8 Projects
Tuesday: ID8 Projects
Wednesday: TV Production
Thursday: TV Production
Friday: Admin (both) + Life
Weekend: Life (protected)
```

### Integrated Approach
```
Morning: Primary domain of the day
Afternoon: Secondary/admin
```

### Project-Based
```
Theme = specific project for the day
Monday: Project A
Tuesday: Project B
Wednesday: Project C
```

---

## Theme Protection Tactics

### Hard Boundaries
- Decline off-theme meetings
- Batch communications
- Auto-responder for theme days
- Calendar blocks

### Soft Boundaries
- Prefer to reschedule off-theme requests
- Reserve 10% for exceptions
- Log theme violations to spot patterns

### Communicating Themes
"I protect Tuesdays for deep work. Could we do Thursday instead?"
"I take all external calls on Thursdays. Want to book time?"

---

## Theme Flexibility

### Fixed vs. Flexible Themes

**Fixed:** Same every week
- Pro: Predictable, habitual
- Con: Less adaptable

**Flexible:** Adjusted weekly
- Pro: Responds to current priorities
- Con: Requires weekly planning

### Hybrid Approach
- 2-3 fixed theme days
- 2-3 flexible days
- Weekend protected

---

## Handling Exceptions

### When Themes Break
They will sometimes. Handle by:
1. Accept the exception
2. Protect the remaining time
3. Reschedule theme work to another day
4. Don't compound by giving up entirely

### Emergency Days
Some days everything goes out the window.
- Accept it
- Do what must be done
- Return to themes tomorrow

### Post-Exception Recovery
- Next day: Return to schedule
- Don't try to "make up" lost theme
- Trust the system over time

---

## Weekly Theme Planning

### Sunday/Monday Morning
1. Review this week's themes
2. Adjust for known commitments
3. Set primary focus for each day
4. Block calendar accordingly

### Template

```markdown
## Week of {date}

| Day | Theme | Primary Focus | Protected Hours |
|-----|-------|---------------|-----------------|
| Mon | {theme} | {focus} | {time} |
| Tue | {theme} | {focus} | {time} |
| Wed | {theme} | {focus} | {time} |
| Thu | {theme} | {focus} | {time} |
| Fri | {theme} | {focus} | {time} |

### Exceptions This Week
- {day}: {exception and reason}

### Week's Top 3 Outcomes
1. {outcome}
2. {outcome}
3. {outcome}
```

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### Weekly Themes + Daily Methods
Theme sets the type of work; daily method organizes it:
- Deep Work Day → Time Blocking or Pomodoro
- Admin Day → Batching or 2-Minute Rule
- Meeting Day → Eisenhower for prep

### Weekly Themes + 1-3-5
1-3-5 constrained by theme:
- Big task from theme domain
- Medium tasks mostly theme
- Small tasks can be mixed

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Rigid Themes
Zero flexibility, declining everything.
**Fix:** 90% theme, 10% flex.

### 2. Too Many Themes
Each day has 3 themes.
**Fix:** One primary theme per day.

### 3. Ignoring External Reality
Themes don't account for fixed meetings.
**Fix:** Build themes around immovable constraints.

### 4. No Communication
Others don't know your themes.
**Fix:** Tell stakeholders. Protect boundaries.

### 5. Abandoning After One Failure
One exception = give up on themes.
**Fix:** Exceptions are normal. Return to structure.
