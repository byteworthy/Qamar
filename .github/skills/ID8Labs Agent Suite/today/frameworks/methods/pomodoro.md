# Pomodoro Technique

## Overview

The Pomodoro Technique uses timed work intervals (traditionally 25 minutes) followed by short breaks. Named after the tomato-shaped kitchen timer used by creator Francesco Cirillo.

The power: it makes tasks feel small and manageable, and gives you permission to focus completely knowing a break is coming.

## The Basic Rhythm

```
🍅 25 minutes WORK
☕ 5 minutes BREAK
🍅 25 minutes WORK
☕ 5 minutes BREAK
🍅 25 minutes WORK
☕ 5 minutes BREAK
🍅 25 minutes WORK
🌴 15-30 minutes LONG BREAK
```

Four pomodoros = one "pomodoro set" = approximately 2 hours with breaks.

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- High resistance tasks (makes them feel smaller)
- Focus problems (time-boxing helps)
- Tracking work time accurately
- Learning or deep work
- Tasks that feel endless

**Not ideal for:**
- Flow state work (interrupts momentum)
- Very short tasks (<25 min total)
- Collaborative/meeting-heavy days
- Creative work that needs flexibility

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Choose Your Task
Pick one task to focus on. Just one.

### Step 2: Set Timer
25 minutes (or your preferred interval).

### Step 3: Work Until Timer Rings
Rules:
- Full focus on the one task
- No checking email/messages
- If interrupted, note it and return
- If you finish early, review or continue

### Step 4: Take a Break
5 minutes:
- Step away from desk
- Stretch, walk, rest eyes
- Don't start new tasks
- Let your brain reset

### Step 5: Repeat
After 4 pomodoros, take a longer break (15-30 min).

## Handling Interruptions

### Internal Interruptions
Thoughts that pop up ("I should check email").

**Response:**
1. Note it on a piece of paper
2. Return to task immediately
3. Address during break

### External Interruptions
Someone needs you.

**Response:**
1. "Can this wait 15 minutes?"
2. If yes → note it, return to work
3. If no → void the pomodoro, restart after

## Pomodoro Variations

### Classic (25/5)
Standard 25-minute work, 5-minute break.
Best for: Most tasks, building the habit.

### Deep Focus (50/10)
Longer intervals for complex work.
Best for: Programming, writing, design.

### Micro (15/3)
Shorter intervals for high resistance.
Best for: Tasks you're really avoiding.

### Flow (45/15)
Extended work for creative sessions.
Best for: When you know you'll hit flow state.

## Estimating with Pomodoros

Use pomodoros as a time unit:

| Pomodoros | Actual Time | Task Size |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| 1 🍅 | 25 min | Small |
| 2 🍅🍅 | 50 min | Medium |
| 3-4 🍅🍅🍅 | 1.5-2 hrs | Large |
| 5+ 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅 | 2.5+ hrs | Break it down |

Estimate tasks in pomodoros, then track actual.

## Daily Planning with Pomodoros

### Morning Setup

1. List today's tasks
2. Estimate pomodoros for each
3. Check: Do you have enough pomodoros?
   - 8 pomodoros = realistic full day
   - 10-12 = ambitious
   - 12+ = too much

4. Prioritize based on available pomodoros

### Example

```markdown
## Today: 8 pomodoros available

| Task | Est | Actual |
|------|-----|--------|
| Write auth flow | 🍅🍅 | |
| Review episode 3 | 🍅🍅 | |
| Email cleanup | 🍅 | |
| Meeting prep | 🍅 | |
| Admin batch | 🍅🍅 | |
| **Total** | 8 | |
```

---

## Tracking

### Simple Tracking
Just count completed pomodoros:
```
Today: 🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅🍅 (6 pomodoros)
```

### Detailed Tracking
Track what you worked on:
```
🍅 9:00 - Auth flow
🍅 9:30 - Auth flow
☕ Break
🍅 10:05 - Episode review
🍅 10:35 - Episode review
```

### Weekly Metrics
- Total pomodoros completed
- Average per day
- Accuracy of estimates
- Tasks completed

## Combining with Other Methods

### Pomodoro + Eat the Frog
Start your first pomodoro on your hardest task.

### Pomodoro + Time Blocking
Block 2-hour chunks, use pomodoros within them.

### Pomodoro + Eisenhower
Use pomodoros for Q1 and Q2 tasks.

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Rigid Timer Worship
Stopping mid-flow because timer rang.
**Fix:** If in flow, extend. Pomodoro is a guide, not a prison.

### 2. Skipping Breaks
"I'll just keep going..."
**Fix:** Breaks are part of the system. Take them.

### 3. Over-scheduling
Planning 16 pomodoros when 8 is realistic.
**Fix:** Be honest. 6-8 pomodoros is a good day.

### 4. Wrong Tasks
Using pomodoros for tasks that don't need them.
**Fix:** Quick tasks → just do them. Meetings → don't pomodoro.

### 5. Guilt About Interruptions
Feeling bad when a pomodoro gets interrupted.
**Fix:** It happens. Restart cleanly. Don't carry guilt.
