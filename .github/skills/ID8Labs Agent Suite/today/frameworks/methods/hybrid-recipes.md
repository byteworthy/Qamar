# Hybrid Recipes

## Overview

Hybrid Recipes combine multiple productivity methods for specific contexts. No single method is perfect for every situation—these recipes combine the best elements for particular days and challenges.

## How Recipes Work

Each recipe:
1. Combines 2-3 methods
2. Specifies when to use each
3. Explains why the combination works
4. Provides step-by-step application

## Recipe 1: Morning Frog, Afternoon Batch

**Combines:** Eat the Frog + Batching

**Best for:**
- Days with one important task plus admin
- When mornings are high-energy
- Mixed task types

**The Recipe:**
```
Morning (Peak Energy)
└── EAT THE FROG
    - Identify hardest/most important task
    - Do it first, before anything else
    - Full focus until complete

Afternoon (Lower Energy)
└── BATCHING
    - Group remaining tasks by type
    - Email batch: 30 min
    - Admin batch: 30 min
    - Calls batch: 30 min
```

**Why it works:**
- Uses peak energy for hardest work
- Saves low-cognitive work for dip
- Feels accomplished after frog eaten
- Admin doesn't block important work

## Recipe 2: Eisenhower + Time Blocking

**Combines:** Eisenhower Matrix + Time Blocking

**Best for:**
- Medium-heavy task days
- When prioritization and execution both matter
- Days needing structure

**The Recipe:**
```
Step 1: EISENHOWER (5 min)
└── Categorize all tasks into quadrants
    - Q1: Do Now
    - Q2: Schedule
    - Q3: Delegate/Batch
    - Q4: Delete

Step 2: TIME BLOCKING (5 min)
└── Block calendar by quadrant
    - Q1 tasks: Immediate blocks
    - Q2 tasks: Protected deep work blocks
    - Q3 tasks: Batched afternoon block

Step 3: EXECUTE
└── Follow blocks throughout day
    - Work by block, not by list
    - Adjust blocks if needed
```

**Why it works:**
- Eisenhower decides what
- Time blocking decides when
- No decision fatigue during day

## Recipe 3: GTD Capture + 1-3-5 Execute

**Combines:** GTD (Capture/Clarify) + 1-3-5 Rule

**Best for:**
- Overwhelming days
- When you don't know what's on your plate
- Need both clarity and structure

**The Recipe:**
```
Phase 1: GTD CAPTURE (10 min)
└── Brain dump everything
    - All tasks, ideas, worries
    - Don't organize, just capture
    - Empty your head completely

Phase 2: GTD CLARIFY (5 min)
└── Process each item
    - Actionable? Yes/No
    - Next action defined
    - Two-minute rule applied

Phase 3: 1-3-5 SELECT (3 min)
└── From clarified list, choose:
    - 1 Big task (highest impact)
    - 3 Medium tasks
    - 5 Small tasks

Phase 4: EXECUTE
└── Work through 1-3-5 list
    - Big task first (or energy-matched)
    - Complete 9 tasks
```

**Why it works:**
- GTD clears the mental clutter
- 1-3-5 provides realistic structure
- Overwhelm → Clarity → Execution

## Recipe 4: Pomodoro + Energy Mapping

**Combines:** Pomodoro Technique + Energy Mapping

**Best for:**
- High-resistance tasks
- Variable energy days
- Need for focus and pacing

**The Recipe:**
```
Step 1: ENERGY CHECK
└── Assess current energy (1-10)
    - Morning typically higher
    - Post-lunch dip
    - Afternoon recovery

Step 2: TASK-ENERGY MATCH
└── Assign tasks to energy levels
    - High energy: Hard tasks
    - Medium energy: Moderate tasks
    - Low energy: Easy tasks

Step 3: POMODORO EXECUTION
└── Work in 25-min sprints
    - High energy: Hard task pomodoros
    - Low energy: Easy task pomodoros
    - Take all breaks

Step 4: ADJUST
└── Re-check energy after each set
    - Shift tasks if energy changes
    - More breaks if depleted
```

**Why it works:**
- Energy mapping ensures right task at right time
- Pomodoro maintains focus regardless of energy
- Breaks prevent burnout

## Recipe 5: Weekly Themes + Daily Ivy Lee

**Combines:** Weekly Themes + Ivy Lee Method

**Best for:**
- Multi-domain work (ID8 + TV + Life)

## Recipe 6: Must-Should-Could + Two-Minute Sweep

**Combines:** Must-Should-Could + Two-Minute Rule

**Best for:**
- Overwhelmed/heavy days

**The Recipe:**
```
Phase 1: MSC TRIAGE (3 min)
└── Categorize everything
    - MUST: Non-negotiable today
    - SHOULD: Important if time
    - COULD: Nice to have

Phase 2: TWO-MINUTE SWEEP (15 min)
└── Quick win momentum

    - No guilt about COULDs
    - Single focus

Phase 4: SHOULD PROGRESS
└── If MUSTs done, tackle SHOULDs
