# Energy Mapping

## Overview

Energy Mapping matches tasks to energy levels throughout the day. Instead of fighting your natural rhythms, work with them. High-energy work when you're sharp, low-energy work when you're not.

---

## The Core Principle

**Not all hours are equal.**

Your cognitive capacity varies throughout the day:
- Morning peak (for most people)
- Post-lunch dip
- Afternoon recovery
- Evening wind-down

Matching tasks to energy maximizes output with less effort.

## Energy Patterns

### The Typical Day

```
High    ▓▓▓▓▓░░░░░▓▓▓░░░░░░░░
Medium  ░░░░░▓▓▓▓░░░░▓▓▓░░░░░░
Low     ░░░░░░░░░▓░░░░░░▓▓▓▓▓▓
        6  8  10 12  2  4  6  8
```

**Morning (6-10am):** High energy, peak focus
**Late Morning (10-12pm):** Medium, good for meetings
**Post-Lunch (12-2pm):** Energy dip
**Afternoon (2-4pm):** Recovery, moderate focus
**Late Afternoon (4-6pm):** Declining
**Evening (6pm+):** Low for most

*Your pattern may differ. Track and adjust.*

## Task-Energy Matching

### High Energy Tasks
Best when sharp and focused:
- Deep thinking
- Creative work
- Complex problems
- Learning new things
- Writing (first drafts)
- Strategic decisions
- Difficult conversations

### Medium Energy Tasks
Good for moderate capacity:
- Meetings
- Collaboration
- Editing and review
- Moderate decisions
- Project planning
- Communication

### Low Energy Tasks
Can do when depleted:
- Email triage
- Admin tasks
- Routine updates
- Simple organization
- Calendar management
- Reading (light)
- Data entry

---

## When to Use

**Good for:**
- Low energy days
- Optimizing productivity
- Understanding your patterns
- Sustainable work pace
- Preventing burnout

**Not ideal for:**
- Deadline-driven days (must work regardless of energy)
- When schedule is externally fixed
- Very short task lists

---

## How to Apply

### Step 1: Know Your Pattern
Track for a week:
- When do you feel sharpest?
- When do you slump?
- When do you recover?

### Step 2: Categorize Tasks
For each task, assign energy level:
- **High:** Requires deep focus, concentration
- **Medium:** Needs engagement but not peak focus
- **Low:** Can do on autopilot

### Step 3: Map to Day
Assign tasks to appropriate time slots:
- High-energy tasks → Peak hours
- Low-energy tasks → Slump times
- Medium → Transition periods

### Step 4: Respect the Map
Don't fight it:
- If it's slump time, do slump work
- Save hard things for peaks
- Let rhythm guide, not guilt

## Energy Assessment

### Morning Check-In
Ask yourself:
- How did I sleep? (Good/OK/Poor)
- Energy right now? (1-10)
- Mental clarity? (1-10)
- Physical state? (Rested/Tired/Exhausted)

### Adjust Day Plan
Based on assessment:
- Good day → Standard plan, high ambition
- OK day → Slightly reduced, protect peaks
- Poor day → Survival mode, low-energy focus

## Personal Energy Audit

### Track for One Week

| Day | Peak Time | Dip Time | Recovery | Pattern Notes |
|-----|-----------|----------|----------|---------------|
| Mon | 8-10am | 1-2pm | 3-4pm | Normal day |
| Tue | 9-11am | 2-3pm | 4pm | Late start |
| Wed | 7-9am | 12-1pm | 2-3pm | Early rise |
| Thu | 8-10am | 2-4pm | 4-5pm | Lots of meetings |
| Fri | 9-11am | 1-3pm | n/a | Wind down |

### Identify Patterns
- Consistent peak time: ______
- Consistent dip: ______
- Best recovery: ______
- Outliers and causes: ______

---

## Protecting Peak Hours

### Rules for Peak Time
1. No meetings during peak (if possible)
2. No email during peak
3. Phone on silent
4. Hardest task scheduled
5. Environment optimized

### If You Must Sacrifice Peak
- Do it intentionally
- Reschedule the hard task
- Don't try to do hard work during dip

---

## Energy Boosters and Drainers

### Energy Boosters
- Movement/exercise
- Natural light
- Caffeine (timed)
- Short breaks
- Fresh air
- Music (for some)
- Progress on tasks

### Energy Drainers
- Long meetings
- Difficult conversations
- Decision fatigue
- Poor sleep
- Hunger
- Dehydration
- Context switching

### Strategic Use
- Use boosters before important tasks
- Schedule drainers during higher energy
- Protect post-drainer recovery

---

## Combining with Other Methods

### Energy Mapping + Time Blocking
Block by energy, not just time:
- Peak block: Deep work
- Dip block: Admin/email
- Recovery block: Medium tasks

### Energy Mapping + Eat the Frog
Frog goes in peak hours. Always.

### Energy Mapping + Pomodoro
During dips, use Pomodoro to maintain focus despite lower energy.

### Energy Mapping + 1-3-5
- "1" big task → Peak hours
- "3" medium → Recovery hours
- "5" small → Dip hours

---

## Low Energy Day Protocol

When energy is globally low:

### Survival Mode
1. Identify true MUSTs only
2. Do only low-energy appropriate tasks
3. No guilt about productivity
4. Protect tomorrow (rest if needed)

### Minimal Viable Day
- 1-2 essential tasks
- Rest and recovery
- Tomorrow will be better

### Energy Investment
Sometimes rest is the most productive choice.

---

## Pitfalls

### 1. Fighting the Dip
Trying to do deep work during energy low.
**Fix:** Accept the dip. Do appropriate work.

### 2. Wasting Peak on Admin
Answering email during your sharpest hours.
**Fix:** Block admin to specific non-peak times.

### 3. Ignoring Signals
Pushing through when exhausted.
**Fix:** Check in with yourself. Adjust the plan.

### 4. Rigid Scheduling
Assuming same pattern daily.
**Fix:** Daily assessment. Patterns vary.

### 5. All or Nothing
Low energy day = no productivity.
**Fix:** Match work to energy. Something is still possible.
