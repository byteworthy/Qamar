## Purpose

---

## Deal Components

### 1. Purchase Price

**Total consideration breakdown:**

| Component | Description | Typical % |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| Cash at close | Immediate payment | 50-80% |
| Earnout | Performance-based | 10-30% |
| Equity | Stock in acquirer | 0-20% |
| Escrow | Held for indemnity | 10-20% |

### 2. Cash at Close

**What it is:** Money you receive on closing day.

**Considerations:**
- Net of escrow holdback
- Net of debt payoff (if any)
- Net of transaction costs
- Tax implications

**Goal:** Maximize this component; it's guaranteed.

### 3. Earnout

**What it is:** Additional payment based on future performance.

**Common metrics:**
- Revenue targets
- Customer retention
- Product milestones
- Integration milestones

**Earnout structure:**

| Type | Risk Level | Seller Preference |
|------|------------|-------------------|
| Revenue-based | Medium | Prefer (controllable) |
| Profit-based | High | Avoid (less control) |
| Retention-based | Medium | Acceptable |
| Milestone-based | Low | Good for tech goals |

**Earnout red flags:**
- Metrics you can't control
- Integration-dependent goals
- Unrealistic targets
- Long time periods (>2 years)
- No acceleration clauses

### 4. Equity

**What it is:** Stock in the acquiring company.

**Considerations:**

- Valuation of equity

**Risk factors:**

- May have restrictions
- Tax implications differ

### 5. Escrow/Holdback

**What it is:** Portion held back to cover potential claims.

**Typical terms:**
- Amount: 10-20% of price
- Duration: 12-24 months
- Release: Remaining after claims period

**Negotiate:**
- Lower percentage
- Shorter duration
- Clear release triggers
- Cap on claims

## Tax Considerations

### Deal Structure Tax Impact

| Structure | Seller Tax Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Stock sale | Capital gains (better) |
| Asset sale | Ordinary income on some |
| Installment | Defer some gains |

### Tax Planning

- Consult tax advisor early
- Consider installment sale
- Plan for QSBS exclusion (if applicable)
- Structure earnouts carefully
- Consider state tax implications

---

## Negotiation Strategy

### Priorities Ranking

Rank what matters most (typical seller priority):

1. Total consideration (valuation)
2. Cash at close percentage
3. Earnout terms and achievability
4. Escrow size and duration
5. Employment terms
6. Rep and warranty scope
7. Non-compete scope

### Leverage Points

**More leverage when:**
- Multiple buyers interested
- Business is performing well
- You're not desperate
- Buyer needs you more

**Less leverage when:**
- Single buyer only
- Business declining
- Desperate for exit
- Buyer has alternatives

### Negotiation Tactics

| Situation | Tactic |
|-----------|--------|
| Multiple buyers | Create auction dynamics |
| Strong position | Anchor high |
| Earnout proposed | Make metrics achievable |
| High escrow | Counter with shorter duration |
| Long non-compete | Narrow the scope |

## LOI (Letter of Intent)

### Key LOI Terms

| Term | What to Check |
|------|---------------|
| Price | Total and structure |
| Exclusivity | Duration (30-60 days typical) |
| Due diligence | Scope and timeline |
| Conditions | What could kill the deal |
| Break-up fee | Protection if buyer backs out |

### LOI Red Flags

- Very long exclusivity (>90 days)
- Vague pricing language
