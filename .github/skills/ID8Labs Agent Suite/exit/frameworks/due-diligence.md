## Responding to DD Requests

### Best Practices

**Do:**
- Respond promptly (24-48 hours)
- Be organized (clear folder structure)
- Be honest (disclose issues upfront)
- Be thorough (anticipate follow-ups)
- Track what you've shared

**Don't:**
- Hide problems (they'll find them)
- Provide incomplete data
- Make verbal claims without documentation
- Delay responses (creates suspicion)
- Share confidential customer data without consent

### Handling Problems

When DD uncovers issues:

1. **Acknowledge** the issue clearly
2. **Explain** the context and cause
3. **Present** your mitigation plan
4. **Offer** reasonable solutions (escrow, price adjustment)
5. **Document** any agreements

## DD Protection

### Confidentiality

- Execute NDA before sharing anything
- Watermark documents
- Use secure data room
- Track document access
- Limit scope of initial sharing

### What to Hold Back

Initially share:
- Summary information
- Aggregated data
- Sanitized examples

Only share after LOI:
- Customer names/contacts
- Proprietary technology details
- Detailed financial data
- Employee compensation
