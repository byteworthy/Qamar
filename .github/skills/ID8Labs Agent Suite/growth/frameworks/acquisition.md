| Consideration | Comparison | "X vs Y for Z" |
| Decision | Product content | "How [Product] works" |

### SEO Basics

**Keyword Research:**
```
"{problem} solution"
"how to {solve problem}"
"best {product type}"
"{competitor} alternative"
"{industry} tools"
```

**On-Page:**
- Target one keyword per page
- Keyword in title, H1, URL
- Answer the search intent
- Internal linking

**Content Calendar:**

### Reddit Strategy

**Good posts:**
```

```

**Bad posts:**
```
"Check out my new app!"
"Use this tool for Y"
Anything without context
```
