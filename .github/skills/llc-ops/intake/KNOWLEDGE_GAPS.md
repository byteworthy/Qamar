**Owner Profile:** Eddie - Has some basics, wants aggressive optimization, prefers delegation

## Gap Analysis

### What Eddie Knows
- [x] LLC provides liability protection
- [x] Need separate bank account
- [x] Business expenses are deductible
- [x] Taxes exist (estimated, self-employment)

### What Eddie Needs to Learn

#### Priority 1: Gray Area Navigation
**Gap:** Wants aggressive deductions but doesn't know where the lines are.

**Key Questions to Answer:**
- What's clearly deductible vs clearly not?
- Where's the gray zone and how aggressive can I be?
- What triggers audits vs what doesn't?
- How do I document to defend aggressive positions?

**Teaching Moments:**
| Topic | Safe | Gray | Red Flag |
|-------|------|------|----------|
| Home Office | Dedicated room, simplified method | Dedicated "area" in room | Kitchen table, bedroom |
| Software | Business tools used for work | Personal/business mixed tools | Netflix, gaming |
| Meals | Client meetings with notes | Solo working lunch | Personal dinners |
| Equipment | Computer used 100% for work | Computer used 80% for work | Family iPad |
| Travel | Client meeting, conference | "Working vacation" | Vacation with laptop |

---

#### Priority 2: Audit Defense
**Gap:** How to document so aggressive positions hold up.

**Key Principles:**
1. **Contemporaneous records win** - Notes at time of expense > reconstructed later
2. **Business purpose documented** - "Lunch with X to discuss Y project"
3. **Reasonable is defensible** - 70% business use is believable, 100% is suspicious
4. **Consistency matters** - Same treatment every time

**What to Document:**
| Expense Type | Minimum Documentation |
|--------------|----------------------|
| Any $75+ | Receipt |
| Meals | Receipt + who + why |
| Travel | Receipt + business purpose |
| Home office | Photos + measurements |
| Vehicle | Mileage log (date, destination, miles, purpose) |
| Mixed-use items | Usage log or reasonable allocation |

---

#### Priority 3: Self-Employment Tax Mechanics
**Gap:** Understands it exists, not how it works.

**The Math:**
```
W-2 Job: Employer pays 7.65%, you pay 7.65% = 15.3% total
LLC: YOU pay both halves = 15.3%

But actually:
- Only pay on 92.35% of net profit (adjustment)
- Can deduct 50% of SE tax on Form 1040
- Social Security portion caps at $176,100 (2025)

Effective SE tax: ~14% on first ~$176K of combined income
```

**Why This Matters:**
- This is WHY aggressive deductions matter
- Every $1,000 of legitimate deductions saves ~$370

---

#### Priority 4: S-Corp Decision Framework
**Gap:** Heard of it, doesn't know when it makes sense.

**The Basics:**
- S-Corp = tax election, not different entity type
- Splits income: salary (subject to SE tax) + distributions (not subject to SE tax)
- Trade-off: Save SE tax vs payroll costs/complexity

**When It Makes Sense:**
```
DON'T elect if:
- Net profit < $40-50K (savings < costs)
- Income is inconsistent year-to-year
- Want simplicity

DO elect if:
- Consistent profit > $50K after reasonable salary
- Can handle $500-1500/year payroll service
- Want to save ~5-10% on excess profits
```

**For Eddie:**
- NOT relevant now (pre-revenue)
- Revisit when: consistent $4K+/month LLC profit
- Flag: STRATEGIST will model when time comes

---

#### Priority 5: Retirement Account Options
**Gap:** No current retirement contributions - huge tax opportunity.

**Options When Revenue Exists:**

| Account | 2025 Limit | Best For |
|---------|------------|----------|
| **SEP IRA** | 25% of net SE, max $70K | Simple, high contribution, no admin |
| **Solo 401(k)** | $23,500 + 25%, max $70K | Higher limits at lower income, loans |
| **Roth IRA** | $7,000 | Tax-free growth, income limits apply |
| **HSA** | $4,300 | Triple tax advantage if high-deductible health plan |

**Current W-2 Consideration:**
- If employer offers 401(k) with match → max the match first
- If no employer 401(k) → Traditional/Roth IRA available now
- LLC retirement accounts → only make sense with LLC income

## Teaching Modules for MENTOR

### Module 1: "What Can I Actually Deduct?"
Teach the ordinary/necessary test, reasonable standard, and audit risk levels.

### Module 2: "The 30% Rule"
Why 30% goes to taxes, how SE tax works, why deductions matter so much.

### Module 3: "Audit-Proof Documentation"
What to save, how to note business purpose, why contemporaneous matters.

### Module 4: "The S-Corp Decision"
When to revisit, how to model, why it's not relevant yet.

### Module 5: "Building Wealth Tax-Efficiently"
Retirement accounts, QBI deduction, timing strategies.

## Learning Triggers

When Eddie says... MENTOR should...
| Trigger | Teaching Response |
|---------|-------------------|
| "Can I deduct X?" | Explain yes/no/gray + audit risk |
| "What happens if I'm audited?" | Walk through audit process, what they look for |
| "Should I do S-Corp?" | Model the numbers, explain break-even |
| "How much should I save for taxes?" | Explain the 30% rule with his specific numbers |
| "What's a [tax term]?" | Define in plain English, explain why it matters to him |

## First Teaching Session

**Suggested Start:**
> "Hey Eddie, before we dive into the filings, let me give you the 5-minute version of why everything we're about to do matters for your taxes. This will help you understand why I'm recommending certain things..."

Then cover:
1. LLC income taxed at ~37% (22% income + 15% SE)
2. Every deduction saves ~$370 per $1,000
3. Documentation is your audit armor
4. Gray areas exist - aggressive is fine if defensible
