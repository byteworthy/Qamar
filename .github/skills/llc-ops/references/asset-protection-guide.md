Comprehensive risk management for ID8Labs LLC.

## Protection Philosophy

Asset protection is about **layering defenses**. No single protection is perfect, but multiple layers make you a hard target.

## Layer 1: LLC Shield

### What the LLC Protects

**Protected:**
- Personal assets (home, car, savings) from business debts
- Personal assets from business lawsuits
- Personal liability for employee/contractor actions

**NOT Protected:**
- Personal negligence (you personally did something wrong)
- Personal guarantees on loans/leases
- Taxes you personally owe
- Fraud or illegal activity

### Maintaining the Shield

The LLC shield can be "pierced" if you don't treat it as a separate entity.

**DO:**
- ✅ Keep completely separate bank account
- ✅ Maintain signed Operating Agreement
- ✅ Conduct business in LLC name (not personal)
- ✅ Sign contracts as "Eduardo Belaval, Member of ID8Labs LLC"
- ✅ Keep adequate capital in the business
- ✅ Document major business decisions
- ✅ File annual reports on time
- ✅ Pay LLC debts from LLC account

**DON'T:**
- ❌ Pay personal expenses from business account
- ❌ Pay business expenses from personal account
- ❌ Treat LLC funds as your personal piggy bank
- ❌ Sign contracts personally (always sign as LLC)
- ❌ Neglect LLC formalities
- ❌ Undercapitalize (keep reasonable reserves)

### Operating Agreement

Even for single-member LLCs, an Operating Agreement provides:

1. **Evidence of Formality** — Shows you treat LLC seriously
2. **Charging Order Protection** — In FL, strengthens creditor protection
3. **Operating Rules** — How decisions are made
4. **Succession Planning** — What happens if you're incapacitated

**Key Provisions:**
- Capital contribution records
- Profit distribution rules
- Decision-making authority
- Transfer restrictions
- Dissolution procedures

## Layer 2: Insurance

### Essential Coverages

#### Professional Liability (E&O)

**What it covers:** Claims that your professional services caused harm.

| Example Claims | Covered? |
|----------------|----------|
| Software bug causes client data loss | Yes |
| Missed deadline causes client damages | Yes |
| Client claims your advice was wrong | Yes |
| Contract dispute over deliverables | Often |

**Recommended Coverage:** $1M-$2M per occurrence

**Cost Estimate:** $300-$800/year for software consultant

**Providers:**
- Hiscox
- Hartford
- Travelers

#### General Liability

**What it covers:** Bodily injury, property damage, personal injury.

| Example Claims | Covered? |
|----------------|----------|
| Client trips in your office | Yes |
| You damage client property | Yes |
| Advertising injures competitor | Yes |

**For home-based software business:** Often bundled, lower priority than E&O.

**Recommended Coverage:** $1M per occurrence

### What to Tell Insurers

- Client types (enterprise vs startup)
- Data handled (PII, financial, health)
- Number of employees/contractors

## Layer 3: Contract Protections

exceed the fees paid by Client under this Agreement during the
twelve (12) months preceding the claim.

```
Client shall indemnify and hold harmless ID8Labs LLC from any
claims arising from Client's use of the deliverables, Client's

### Business Continuity

**What if you're incapacitated?**

3. Notify (clients, insurers, potentially regulators)
4. Remediate (fix the vulnerability)
5. Document (for insurance, legal)

- Document that LLC has independent purpose

### Homestead Exemption

Your primary residence in Florida has unlimited homestead protection from creditors (with some exceptions).

**Not protected from:**
- Mortgages
- Property taxes
- HOA liens
- Mechanics liens
