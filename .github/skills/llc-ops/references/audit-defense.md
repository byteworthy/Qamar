## Understanding Audits

### Types of IRS Examination

| Type | What Happens | Severity |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Correspondence** | Letter asking for documentation | Low |
| **Office Audit** | You go to IRS office | Medium |
| **Field Audit** | IRS comes to you | High |

**90%+ of small business audits are correspondence audits** — they just want to verify something specific.

### How Audits Are Selected

**Computer Scoring (DIF):**
- IRS compares your return to similar taxpayers
- Unusual ratios flag for review
- Example: Very high expenses vs revenue

**Random Selection:**
- Small percentage are purely random
- Nothing you can do about these

**Document Matching:**
- Your return doesn't match 1099s/W-2s received
- Payer reported income you didn't

**Related Audits:**
- Your client or contractor is audited
- Your return is pulled for review

## Audit Red Flags

### High-Risk Activities

| Red Flag | Why It's Flagged |
|----------|------------------|
| Cash business | Hard to verify income |
| High Schedule C income | More complex, more opportunity for error |
| High deductions vs income | Losses or low profit suspicious |
| Home office | Often claimed improperly |
| Vehicle expenses | Frequently overstated |
| Meals & entertainment | Often includes personal |
| Large charitable deductions | Disproportionate to income |
| Round numbers | $10,000 exactly looks estimated |

### For Software Consultants Specifically

**Watch out for:**
- Home office without proper exclusive use
- Claiming 100% business use on car
- No documentation for contractor payments
- Missing 1099s issued to you
- Deducting equipment that's partially personal

### Red Flag Ratios

| Ratio | Normal Range | Red Flag |
|-------|--------------|----------|
| Net Profit Margin | 20-60% | Below 10% or losses for years |
| Home Office % | 5-20% | Above 30% |
| Vehicle Business % | 50-80% | Claiming 100% |
| Meals as % of Revenue | 1-5% | Above 10% |

## Documentation Standards

### The IRS Rule

The IRS doesn't require receipts for expenses under $75, EXCEPT:
- Lodging (any amount)
- Transportation (any amount)

**BUT:** Good practice is to keep receipts for everything.

### What Good Documentation Looks Like

**For Regular Expenses:**
- Receipt or bank statement
- Date, amount, vendor
- Business purpose clear from vendor name

**For Meals:**
- Receipt (any amount)
- Who attended
- Business purpose discussed
- Date and location

**For Travel:**
- All receipts
- Itinerary
- Business purpose of trip
- Meeting notes or conference agenda

**For Vehicle:**
- Mileage log: date, destination, miles, purpose
- OR actual expense records
- Business vs personal allocation

**For Home Office:**
- Measurement of office space
- Photos showing exclusive business use
- Utility bills
- Lease/mortgage documents

### Record Retention

| Record Type | Keep For |
|-------------|----------|
| Tax returns | Permanently |
| W-2s, 1099s | 7 years |
| Expense receipts | 7 years |
| Bank statements | 7 years |
| Depreciation records | Life of asset + 7 years |
| Business formation docs | Permanently |

**Why 7 years:** Covers 3-year standard statute + buffer for fraud claims.

## Statute of Limitations

### Standard Rules

| Situation | IRS Time Limit |
|-----------|----------------|
| Normal return | 3 years from filing |
| Substantial understatement (>25%) | 6 years |
| Fraud or no return filed | Unlimited |
| State taxes | Varies (FL: 3 years, but federal can extend) |

### Key Dates

**Statute starts:** Later of due date or actual filing date.

**Example:**
- 2024 return due April 15, 2025
- Filed March 1, 2025
- Statute runs from April 15, 2025
- Expires April 15, 2028 (3 years)

**If you extend:**
- Extended return due October 15, 2025
- Filed October 1, 2025
- Statute still runs from April 15, 2025 (original due date)
- Still expires April 15, 2028

## If You Receive Notice

### Step 1: Don't Panic

Most notices are routine:
- Requesting documentation
- Mathematical correction
- Missing information

**You have time.** Notices give 30+ days to respond.

### Step 2: Read Carefully

Identify:
- What specific item is questioned
- What documentation is requested
- Response deadline
- Contact information

### Step 3: Gather Documents

Collect ONLY what's requested:
- Don't send entire years of records
- Don't volunteer extra information
- Organize clearly with cover letter

### Step 4: Consider Representation

**Handle yourself if:**
- Simple documentation request
- Clear error you can explain
- Low dollars involved

**Get professional if:**
- Complex issue
- Large amount at stake
- Fraud allegation
- You don't understand request
- Office or field audit

### Step 5: Respond Timely

**Before deadline:**
- Organize documents
- Write brief cover letter
- Send via certified mail (keep receipt)
- OR respond online if available

**If you need more time:**
- Call number on notice
- Request extension (usually granted)
- Document the conversation

## Types of Representatives

### Who Can Represent You

| Representative | What They Can Do | Best For |
|----------------|------------------|----------|
| **CPA** | Full representation | Most situations |
| **Enrolled Agent** | Full representation | Tax-focused issues |
| **Tax Attorney** | Full representation + privilege | Complex, fraud, criminal |
| **You** | Represent yourself | Simple correspondence |

### Attorney-Client Privilege

Only attorneys have true privilege. CPAs have limited "tax practitioner privilege" for tax advice (not preparation).

**If you suspect anything criminal:** Talk to attorney FIRST.

### Finding Representation

**Look for:**
- Experience with your type of business
- Experience with type of audit
- Clear fee structure
- Responsive communication

**Expect to pay:**
- Correspondence audit: $500-$2,000
- Office audit: $2,000-$5,000
- Field audit: $5,000-$20,000+

## Audit Process

### Correspondence Audit Timeline

1. **Receive notice** (Day 0)
2. **Gather documents** (Days 1-20)
3. **Respond** (Before deadline, usually 30-60 days)
4. **IRS reviews** (4-12 weeks)
5. **Resolution letter** or **Additional questions**
6. **Agree or appeal**

### If You Disagree

**Options:**
1. Request reconsideration (same level)
2. Appeal to IRS Office of Appeals
3. Tax Court (after all administrative)

**Appeals Process:**
- Written protest
- Conference with Appeals Officer
- Settlement negotiations
- Often results in compromise

## Penalties

### Common Penalties

| Penalty | Rate |
|---------|------|
| Failure to file | 5%/month, max 25% |
| Failure to pay | 0.5%/month, max 25% |
| Accuracy-related | 20% of underpayment |
| Fraud | 75% of underpayment |
| Estimated tax | ~3-5% annually |

### Penalty Abatement

**First-time penalty abatement:**
- Available if clean history (3 years)
- Just ask — no special reason needed
- Works for failure-to-file/pay

**Reasonable cause:**
- Death, serious illness
- Fire, natural disaster
- Bad advice from tax professional
- IRS error

**Request in writing:** Explain circumstances, provide documentation.
