The Internal Memo Creator skill helps you craft clear, professional internal memos for company communication. Whether you're documenting a policy change, sharing important information, requesting action, or communicating decisions, this skill ensures your memo is well-structured, appropriately toned, and achieves its communication objectives.

## Memo Types & Templates

### Template 1: Policy Memo

```
MEMORANDUM

TO: All Employees
FROM: Sarah Chen, Chief People Officer
DATE: January 6, 2026
RE: Updated Remote Work Policy - Effective February 1, 2026

We are updating our remote work policy to provide more flexibility while maintaining team collaboration and productivity. This memo outlines the changes and what you need to know.

WHAT'S CHANGING

Effective February 1, 2026, all employees will have the option to work remotely up to three days per week, with a minimum of two days in the office for team collaboration.

Key changes:
• Employees may choose which days to work remotely (subject to team coordination)
• Core collaboration hours of 10 AM - 3 PM remain required for all
• In-office days should be coordinated with immediate team
• Monthly all-hands meetings require in-person attendance

WHY WE'RE MAKING THIS CHANGE

Our employee survey indicated that flexibility is a top priority, while our collaboration data shows that some in-person time is critical for team dynamics. This policy balances both needs.

WHAT YOU NEED TO DO

1. Review the full policy document (attached)
2. Coordinate with your manager on in-office days by January 20
3. Update your calendar to reflect your regular schedule
4. Ensure your home office setup meets our security requirements (IT checklist attached)

RESOURCES

• Full policy document: [Link]
• IT home office guide: [Link]
• FAQ: [Link]
• Questions: people-ops@company.com

This policy will be reviewed quarterly and adjusted based on feedback and business needs.

### Template 2: Decision Memo

```
MEMORANDUM

TO: Product and Engineering Leadership
FROM: Michael Park, VP of Product
DATE: January 6, 2026
RE: Decision to Delay Q1 Feature Release

This memo documents the decision to delay the Q1 major feature release from February 15 to March 15, 2026, and outlines the rationale and next steps.

DECISION

We will delay the launch of the new analytics dashboard by four weeks, moving the release date from February 15 to March 15, 2026.

RATIONALE

This decision was made based on three factors:

1. Quality Concerns: QA testing revealed critical performance issues with large datasets that require additional engineering time to resolve properly.

2. Customer Feedback: Beta customer feedback indicated the need for additional customization options that would significantly improve adoption.

3. Resource Constraints: Two key engineers are out on planned leave in February, reducing our capacity to address issues during what would normally be a critical launch period.

IMPACT

• Sales team has been notified and customer commitments have been updated
• Marketing launch campaign will shift to align with new date
• Q2 roadmap will be adjusted to accommodate the timeline shift
• No impact to other Q1 deliverables

NEXT STEPS

1. Engineering to prioritize performance fixes and additional customization features
2. Product to update roadmap and communicate to stakeholders
3. Marketing to adjust launch campaign timeline
4. Sales enablement session rescheduled to week of March 10

ACTION ITEMS

| Action | Owner | Due Date |
|--------|-------|----------|
| Fix critical performance issues | @Eng Team | Feb 28 |
| Implement customization features | @Product Team | Feb 28 |
| Update customer communications | @Sales Leadership | Jan 10 |
| Revise launch campaign | @Marketing | Jan 15 |
| Update roadmap documentation | @Product Ops | Jan 8 |

MEMORANDUM

TO: Executive Leadership Team
FROM: Pat Davis, Chief of Staff
DATE: January 6, 2026
RE: Summary - Q1 Strategy Meeting (January 5, 2026)

This memo summarizes key decisions, action items, and next steps from yesterday's Q1 strategy meeting.

ATTENDEES

Present: CEO, CFO, CTO, CPO, CMO, VP Sales, VP People
Absent: COO (out on leave)

KEY DECISIONS

1. Q1 Company Goal: Prioritize enterprise customer expansion

Enterprise Focus
Team aligned that enterprise expansion is critical for long-term growth. Current enterprise customers have 3x higher retention and 5x higher LTV than mid-market.

Resource Allocation
General agreement that short-term investment in enterprise sales will require some reallocation from other initiatives. Marketing and product teams committed to supporting the shift.

Competitive Position
Market window is favorable now, but we expect 2-3 competitors to launch similar enterprise features in Q2. Speed is essential.

## Writing Best Practices

### Opening Paragraph
- State the purpose immediately
- Lead with the main point, not background
- Be clear about what this memo is and why they're reading it
- Keep it to 2-3 sentences max

### Body Content
- Use headers to organize information
- Break up text with bullet points and lists
- Keep paragraphs short (3-4 sentences)
- Lead with key information, follow with details
- Be specific with dates, numbers, and expectations

### Closing Paragraph
- Summarize key action items
- Restate deadlines if applicable
- Provide contact for questions
- Thank readers if appropriate

### Tone Guidelines

| Memo Type | Tone | Example Opening |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| Policy | Professional, Clear | "We are implementing a new policy regarding..." |
| Decision | Factual, Direct | "This memo documents the decision to..." |
| Action Request | Clear, Urgent | "We need your input on..." |
| Informational | Helpful, Straightforward | "This memo provides information about..." |
| Directive | Authoritative, Professional | "Effective [date], all staff are required to..." |

## Formatting Best Practices

### Use of Headers
Break content into digestible sections:
- ALL CAPS for major sections
- Title Case for subsections
- Help readers scan quickly

### Lists and Bullets
Use for:
- Multiple related items
- Action items
- Requirements or steps
- Key points or takeaways

### Tables
Use when presenting:
- Action items with owners and dates
- Comparisons
- Timelines or schedules
- Multiple data points

### White Space
- Don't wall-to-wall text
- Line breaks between sections
- Margins for readability
- Make it visually approachable

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- **Burying the Lede**: Put the main point first, not in paragraph 3
- **Too Much Background**: Keep context brief and relevant
- **Vague Language**: Be specific about expectations, dates, actions
- **No Clear Owner**: Always assign responsibility
- **Missing Deadlines**: Give specific dates, not "soon" or "ASAP"
- **Too Informal**: Memos are official documents
- **Too Formal**: Don't sound like a legal contract
- **No Follow-Up Info**: Always provide a contact or next step
- **Assuming Knowledge**: Explain context, don't assume everyone knows
- **Forgetting Attachments**: Reference and include all mentioned documents

## Distribution Best Practices

### Who Gets It
- Only send to those who need to know
- CC those who should be informed
- Use distribution lists for broad audiences
- Consider separate versions for different audiences

### How to Send
- Email for most internal memos
- Printed copies for very formal or required documentation
- Posted to shared drive/intranet for reference
- Announced in relevant channels (Slack, Teams)

### When to Send
- Mid-morning Tuesday-Thursday for best visibility
- Avoid Mondays (busy) and Fridays (end of week)
- Give adequate time before deadlines
- Don't send during major events or holidays

### Follow-Up
- Send reminder for action-required memos
- Check in on completion of requested actions
- Be available for questions
- Update if information changes

## Record Keeping

Memos serve as official documentation:

**What to Archive:**
- All policy memos
- Decision documentation
- Major announcements
- Directives and requirements

**Where to Store:**
- Shared company drive
- Document management system
- Employee handbook for policies
- Department-specific folders

**How Long to Keep:**
- Policies: Until superseded + 1 year
- Decisions: Permanent archive
- Action requests: Until completed + 3 months
- Informational: 1 year minimum

## Integration Points

- **Document Management**: SharePoint, Google Drive, Notion
- **Email System**: Outlook, Gmail
- **Collaboration Tools**: Link from Slack, Teams
- **HR Systems**: Policy memos to employee handbook
- **Project Management**: Link to related projects or initiatives
- **Calendar**: Add deadlines and follow-ups
