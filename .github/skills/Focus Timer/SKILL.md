# Focus Timer

The Focus Timer skill helps you structure focused work sessions using proven time-boxing techniques like the Pomodoro method, deep work blocks, and ultradian rhythm cycles. Rather than hoping to "get in the zone," this skill creates deliberate focus sessions with optimal timing, break patterns, and environmental setup.

This skill applies neuroscience research on attention spans, Cal Newport's deep work principles, and Francesco Cirillo's Pomodoro technique to help you work with your brain's natural rhythms rather than against them. It recognizes that sustained focus is a skill that improves with practice, and provides progressive training to build your deep work capacity.

The system adapts to different work types—creative sessions need different timing than analytical work, collaborative work differs from solo focus—and provides appropriate session structures for each.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Quick Pomodoro
Standard 25-minute focus session:
1. **Task Definition**: What will you work on?
2. **Environment Prep**: Phone away, notifications off
3. **Timer Start**: 25 minutes of focused work
4. **Work Period**: Single-task on defined work
5. **Break**: 5 minutes of true rest
6. **Repeat or Finish**: Continue or wrap session

### Workflow 2: Deep Work Block
Extended focus session (90-120 minutes):
1. **Session Goal**: What will you accomplish?
2. **Environment Design**: Optimal setup for deep focus
3. **Warm-up**: 5-10 minutes to settle in
4. **Deep Work**: 90-120 minutes uninterrupted
5. **Break**: 15-20 minutes recovery
6. **Review**: What got done, what's next

### Workflow 3: Ultradian Rhythm Session
Work with natural 90-minute cycles:
1. **Energy Check**: What's your current state?
2. **Session Planning**: Match work type to energy
3. **90-Minute Block**: One complete ultradian cycle
4. **Break Period**: 20 minutes true rest
5. **Energy Reassessment**: Ready for another cycle?

### Workflow 4: Progressive Focus Training
Build deep work capacity over time:
1. **Baseline Assessment**: How long can you focus now?
2. **Progressive Loading**: Gradually extend focus duration
3. **Consistency Building**: Regular practice schedule
4. **Difficulty Progression**: More challenging work over time
5. **Capacity Tracking**: Monitor improvement

### Workflow 5: Sprint Session
Intense short-burst focus:
1. **Clear Objective**: One specific task
2. **Time Constraint**: 15-45 minutes max
3. **Full Intensity**: No breaks, maximum focus
4. **Completion**: Finish or timebox expires
5. **Recovery**: Longer break after sprint

## Focus Frameworks

### The Pomodoro Technique (Classic)

**Session Structure:**
- 25 minutes: Focused work
- 5 minutes: Short break
- Repeat 4 times
- 15-30 minutes: Long break

**Best for:**
- Task-based work with clear deliverables
- Building focus habit
- Managing energy through the day
- Avoiding burnout

**Rules:**
- If interrupted, restart the Pomodoro
- Use break time for actual rest (not checking email)
- Plan tomorrow during final break

### Deep Work Blocks (Cal Newport)

**Session Structure:**
- 60-240 minutes: Uninterrupted deep work
- 15-30 minutes: Recovery break
- Maximum 4 hours deep work per day

**Best for:**
- Complex creative work
- Writing and analysis
- Learning difficult material
- Strategic thinking

**Requirements:**
- Eliminate all distractions
- Work in location with minimal interruptions
- Single task only
- High-quality output focus

### Ultradian Rhythm Cycles

**Session Structure:**
- 90 minutes: Work aligned with natural cycle
- 20 minutes: Rest to complete cycle
- Repeat 3-4 times per day max

**Best for:**
- Knowledge work
- Creative tasks
- Learning and development
- Sustainable productivity

**Science:**
- Humans naturally cycle between high and low alertness every 90-120 minutes
- Working with cycles prevents burnout
- Breaks allow processing and integration

### The 52-17 Method

**Session Structure:**
- 52 minutes: Focused work
- 17 minutes: Break

**Best for:**
- Desk workers
- Software development
- Research and analysis

**Research:**
- Based on productivity study of most productive workers
- Specific timing optimizes focus/rest balance

### Modified Sprint Method

**Session Structure:**
- 30-45 minutes: Maximum intensity work
- 10-15 minutes: Active recovery
- 2-3 sprints max per day

**Best for:**
- High-stakes deliverables
- Creative bursts
- Problem-solving sessions
- Tight deadlines

- Structured timing aids concentration

### Administrative Work (Email, Scheduling, Reports)
**Recommended**: Pomodoro (25-5)
- Task-oriented work suits shorter blocks
- Frequent breaks prevent boredom
- Time-boxing prevents expansion

### Learning (Study, Courses, Skill Practice)
**Recommended**: 45-minute sessions with 15-min breaks
- Matches academic class structure
- Allows processing time
- Sustainable for multiple sessions

### Collaborative Work (Meetings, Pairing, Reviews)
**Recommended**: 50-minute blocks (not timers, but scheduled endpoints)
- Respects others' time
- Leaves buffer between sessions
- Allows prep time for next commitment

## Best Practices

- **Define the task before starting timer** - Don't waste focus time deciding what to do
- **Prep your environment** - Remove distractions before session starts
- **Use actual breaks** - Scrolling social media isn't rest
- **Single-task ruthlessly** - Focus means one thing, not "one main thing"
- **Track your patterns** - When are you most focused? What helps?
- **Protect the timer** - If interrupted, either restart or reschedule
- **Start small** - 25 minutes is better than failed 2-hour attempts
- **Build gradually** - Increase duration as capacity grows
- **Match method to work** - Different tasks need different timing
- **Respect your energy** - Don't force deep work when depleted
- **End sessions properly** - Note what's next before breaking
- **Celebrate completions** - Acknowledge focused work
- **Review and improve** - What made this session work or fail?
- **Schedule sessions** - Focus time doesn't happen accidentally
- **Use rituals** - Same warm-up routine = faster flow state

## Environment Optimization

### Digital Environment
**Before Session:**
- Close email, Slack, messaging apps
- Use website blockers (Freedom, Cold Turkey, Focus)
- Turn off notifications (ALL notifications)
- Put phone on Do Not Disturb + in another room
- Close unnecessary browser tabs
- Use full-screen mode for working app

### Physical Environment
**Optimize for Focus:**
- Minimal clutter in visual field
- Comfortable temperature
- Good lighting (natural light ideal)
- Noise management (silence, white noise, or specific music)
- Comfortable seating
- Water nearby
- Bathroom break before session
- Sign on door if shared space

### Auditory Environment
**Options:**
- Silence (if available)
- White/brown noise (blocks distractions)
- Instrumental music (Brain.fm, lo-fi, classical)
- Nature sounds
- Noise-cancelling headphones

**Avoid:**
- Music with lyrics (competes for language processing)
- Podcasts or audiobooks (same problem)
- Unpredictable sounds

## Common Focus Challenges

### Challenge: Can't start
**Solution**: Make it tiny - "Just 5 minutes" often becomes more

### Challenge: Constant interruptions
**Solution**: Communicate boundaries, physical "do not disturb" signal, different location

### Challenge: Mental wandering
**Solution**: Note distracting thoughts on paper to address later, refocus on breath, start with easier task to build momentum

### Challenge: Loss of motivation mid-session
**Solution**: Review why this matters, take micro-break (30 sec), break task into smaller pieces

### Challenge: Post-session fatigue
**Solution**: Take real breaks, don't chain too many sessions, match session length to current capacity

### Challenge: Can't maintain consistency
**Solution**: Schedule specific times, start smaller, track streaks for motivation

## Integration Points

This skill works well with:
- **Daily Planner**: Schedule focus blocks in daily plan
- **Time Blocker**: Reserve focus time on calendar
- **Habit Tracker**: Build consistent focus practice
- **Goal Setter**: Allocate focused time to goal work
- **Learning Path Creator**: Use focus sessions for learning

## Example Focus Session

**User**: "start focus session"

**Skill Response**:
"Let's create some focused work time. A few quick questions to set this up right:

**1. What are you working on?**
(Be specific - 'work on project' is too vague, 'write intro section for proposal' is actionable)

**2. How much time do you have?**
- Quick Pomodoro (25 min + 5 min break)?
- Deep work block (90-120 min)?
- Custom duration?

**3. What's your energy level right now?**
- High (ready for challenging work)?
- Medium (can focus but not on hardest stuff)?
- Low (struggling to concentrate)?

This helps me recommend the right approach."

**User**: "Need to write a report, have 2 hours, energy is high"

**Skill Response**:
"Perfect—high energy + 2 hours = ideal for a deep work block. Writing needs uninterrupted flow, so let's set this up properly.

**Pre-session checklist** (take 2 minutes for this):
- [ ] Phone: On Do Not Disturb + in another room
- [ ] Computer: Close email, Slack, messaging
- [ ] Environment: Quiet, comfortable, water nearby
- [ ] Bathroom break taken
- [ ] Know EXACTLY what part of the report you're starting with

**Recommended structure:**
- 0-5 min: Warm-up (review outline, get oriented)
- 5-95 min: Deep work on report (90 minutes uninterrupted)
- 95-115 min: Break (real rest, no screens)
- 115-120 min: Quick review of what's next

**Ready to start?**

When you say 'go', I'll start the timer. During the work block, ignore everything except the report. We'll check in at the 90-minute mark.

Say 'go' when your environment is prepped."

**User**: "go"

**Skill Response**:
"Timer started. Focus mode activated. ⏱️

**Your task**: Write the report
**Duration**: 90 minutes
**End time**: [specific time]

I'll check back at the 90-minute mark. If you need to end early, just say 'end session'.

Now disappear into the work. You've got this. 🎯"

*[After 90 minutes]*

**Skill Response**:
"**Session complete!** ✅

90 minutes of focused work—well done.

**Quick session review:**
1. What did you accomplish?
2. How was your focus quality? (1-10)
3. Any interruptions or challenges?

Take your break now (15-20 min). Move around, hydrate, rest your brain. No screens during break if possible.

Want to schedule another session after your break, or are you done for now?"
