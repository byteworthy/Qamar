# Onboarding Designer

Expert user onboarding system that transforms first-time visitors into activated, successful users. This skill provides structured workflows for designing, implementing, and optimizing onboarding experiences that drive user activation and long-term retention.

Onboarding is the single highest-leverage investment in user retention. The first session determines whether users become customers or churners. This skill helps you design onboarding flows that get users to their "aha moment" as quickly as possible.

Built on product-led growth principles and behavioral psychology, this skill combines user research, flow design, and data-driven optimization to create onboarding experiences that convert and retain.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Activation Definition
**Define what "activated" means for your product**

1. **Aha Moment Discovery**
   - Analyze user cohorts (retained vs. churned)
   - Identify behaviors correlated with retention
   - Find the minimum valuable action
   - Define time window for activation (first 7 days typical)
   - Document the activation metric

2. **Activation Criteria Examples**
   | Product Type | Activation Metric |
   |--------------|-------------------|
   | SaaS Tool | Completed core action 3+ times |
   | Marketplace | Made first purchase |
   | Social App | Added 5+ connections |
   | Productivity | Created first project/item |
   | B2B Platform | Invited team member |

3. **Activation Funnel**
   - Signup completed
   - Profile/account setup
   - Core feature discovery
   - First meaningful action
   - Repeat action (confirms value)

4. **Measurement Framework**
   - Define each funnel step precisely
   - Set up event tracking
   - Calculate conversion between steps
   - Benchmark against industry standards
   - Set improvement targets

### Workflow 2: Onboarding Flow Design
**Design the path from signup to activation**

1. **Flow Architecture Options**
   - **Linear**: Step-by-step guided sequence
   - **Progressive**: Reveal features as user advances
   - **Checklist**: Self-directed with progress tracking
   - **Contextual**: Just-in-time tips during usage
   - **Hybrid**: Combination approach

2. **Flow Components**
   - **Welcome Screen**: Set expectations, show value
   - **Account Setup**: Collect essential info only
   - **Product Tour**: Highlight key features
   - **First Task**: Guide to initial success
   - **Progress Indicators**: Show completion status
   - **Empty States**: Guide users when no data exists

3. **Personalization Factors**
   - User role/persona
   - Use case/goal
   - Company size
   - Prior experience
   - Entry point/referral source

4. **Flow Principles**
   - Minimize steps to activation
   - Show progress and momentum
   - Celebrate small wins
   - Allow skip but encourage completion
   - Provide escape hatches

### Workflow 3: Content & Messaging
**Write copy that motivates and guides**

1. **Welcome Messaging**
   - Acknowledge the user's goal
   - Preview the value they'll get
   - Set clear expectations
   - Create excitement without overwhelming

2. **Instructional Content**
   - Action-oriented headlines
   - One instruction per screen
   - Visual > text when possible
   - Benefits alongside features
   - Progress indicators

3. **Microcopy Patterns**
   - Buttons: Specific actions ("Create my first project")
   - Labels: Clear, jargon-free
   - Tooltips: Concise, contextual
   - Errors: Helpful, not blaming
   - Empty states: Actionable guidance

4. **Motivation Techniques**
   - Social proof (X users did this)
   - Progress visualization
   - Immediate value demonstration
   - Personalization ("Your dashboard")
   - Commitment and consistency

### Workflow 4: Email Onboarding Sequence
**Support in-app flow with email nurture**

1. **Email Sequence Structure**
   | Day | Email Purpose |
   |-----|---------------|
   | 0 | Welcome + quick win action |
   | 1 | Core feature highlight |
   | 3 | Use case example/inspiration |
   | 5 | Overcome common objection |
   | 7 | Activation check-in or social proof |
   | 14 | Advanced feature or upgrade prompt |

2. **Email Content Principles**
   - One clear CTA per email
   - Link to specific in-app action
   - Keep under 150 words
   - Personalize with user data
   - A/B test subject lines

3. **Behavioral Triggers**
   - Incomplete setup → reminder
   - No login in X days → re-engagement
   - Used feature → related feature intro
   - Approaching limit → upgrade prompt
   - Activation achieved → celebration

4. **Segmentation**
   - By activation status
   - By user persona/role
   - By feature usage
   - By engagement level
   - By signup source

### Workflow 5: Measurement & Optimization
**Track performance and iterate**

1. **Key Metrics**
   - **Activation Rate**: % of signups reaching activated state
   - **Time to Activate**: Days/hours from signup to activation
   - **Funnel Conversion**: % completing each step
   - **Drop-off Points**: Where users abandon
   - **Return Rate**: % returning after first session

2. **Funnel Analysis**
   - Map each onboarding step to event
   - Calculate step-to-step conversion
   - Identify biggest drop-offs
   - Segment by user attributes
   - Compare cohorts over time

3. **Optimization Experiments**
   - A/B test step order
   - Test copy variations
   - Try different UI patterns
   - Experiment with personalization
   - Test email timing and content

4. **Qualitative Research**
   - User session recordings
   - New user interviews
   - Support ticket analysis
   - Churn surveys
   - In-app feedback collection

## Red Flags

- **Information overload**: Too many features introduced at once
- **No quick win**: Users don't experience value in first session
- **Forced completion**: Can't skip non-essential steps
- **No personalization**: Same flow for all user types
- **Missing progress**: No indication of how much is left
- **Dead ends**: Steps without clear next actions
- **Lost progress**: Starting over if user leaves
- **Jargon**: Using internal terminology
