## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Product Listing Optimization

**Purpose:** Create high-converting product listings that rank well in search and persuade customers to buy.

**Optimization Elements:**

**1. Product Title**
- **Structure:** [Brand] + [Primary Keyword] + [Key Features] + [Variation]
- **Best practices:**
  - Front-load primary keywords (first 5 words most important)
  - Include key differentiators (size, color, material, benefit)
  - Natural language, not keyword stuffing
  - Platform-specific character limits (Amazon 200, Shopify 70 recommended)
  - Mobile-friendly (first 50 chars visible on mobile)
- **Examples:**
  - Good: "UltraSoft Bamboo Sheet Set - Cooling, Hypoallergenic - King Size, Navy Blue"
  - Bad: "Best Sheets Ever Super Soft Bamboo Cooling Sheets King Navy"

**2. Product Description**
- **Structure:**
  - Hook (attention-grabbing opening)
  - Benefits (what problem it solves, how it improves life)
  - Features (specifications and details)
  - Social proof (reviews, awards, testimonials)
  - Call-to-action
- **Copywriting principles:**
  - Lead with benefits, support with features
  - Use sensory language and storytelling
  - Address objections and concerns
  - Speak to target customer's pain points
  - Scannable format (short paragraphs, bullet points, headers)
  - Include keywords naturally for SEO
- **Formula:** "Imagine [desired outcome]. Our [product] helps you [benefit] by [unique mechanism]. Unlike [alternative], it [differentiation]."

**3. Bullet Points / Key Features**
- 5-7 bullets highlighting main benefits/features
- Start each bullet with benefit statement
- Include specific, quantifiable details
- Address different customer priorities (quality, price, convenience, etc.)
- Use power words (guaranteed, premium, exclusive, proven)
- Format: BENEFIT - Supporting feature detail
  - Example: "ALL-NIGHT COMFORT - Temperature-regulating bamboo fabric keeps you cool in summer, warm in winter"

**4. Product Images**
- **Minimum requirements:**
  - Primary image: White background, product fills 85%+ of frame
  - 6-8 total images minimum
  - High resolution (2000px+ for zoom functionality)
  - Multiple angles (front, back, side, top, detail shots)
  - Lifestyle images showing product in use
  - Infographic highlighting key features
  - Size/scale reference
  - Packaging (if premium)
- **Best practices:**
  - Professional photography (well-lit, sharp, color-accurate)
  - Show product dimensions visually
  - Demonstrate use cases and benefits
  - Include before/after if applicable
  - Videos significantly increase conversion (30-40% lift typical)

**5. Product Specifications**

  - Bundle pricing - increase average order value
