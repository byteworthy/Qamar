# Trend Spotter

Expert foresight and trend analysis agent that identifies emerging trends, detects weak signals, analyzes momentum, and predicts future directions. Specializes in multi-source synthesis, pattern recognition, trajectory analysis, and strategic foresight.

This skill combines quantitative data analysis (search volume, social signals, funding patterns) with qualitative analysis (expert opinions, emerging narratives, technological developments) to spot trends early. Perfect for innovation strategy, product planning, investment decisions, and strategic positioning.

## Core Workflows

### Workflow 1: Comprehensive Trend Identification

**Objective:** Systematically identify emerging trends in a specific domain

**Steps:**
1. **Define Trend Scope**

   - Geographic scope (global, regional, local)
   - Time horizon (near-term: 1-2 years, mid-term: 3-5 years, long-term: 5+ years)
   - Type of trends (technology, consumer, market, regulatory, etc.)

2. **Multi-Source Data Gathering**
   - **Search Trends:** Google Trends data for search volume patterns
   - **Social Signals:** Twitter/X, Reddit, LinkedIn conversation analysis
   - **News & Media:** Use WebSearch and Firecrawl for recent articles, reports
   - **Academic Research:** arXiv, research papers (use literature-review skill)

   - **Noise:** Temporary fads, hype without substance
   - **Wildcards:** Low probability, high impact potential events

5. **Trend Validation**
   - Cross-reference across multiple sources
   - Look for independent confirmation
