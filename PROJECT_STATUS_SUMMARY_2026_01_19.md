## Hard Blockers to Public Launch

1. Legal documents (ToS, Privacy Policy) not published
2. Crisis resources not verified (evidence log empty)
3. Data retention deletion not implemented
4. Production hosting not configured
5. No monitoring/alerting in place
6. Store screenshots not created
7. App Store/Play Console accounts not set up

---

## Realistic Timelines

**Internal Alpha**: 2-3 weeks (fix critical gaps, verify crisis resources, test with 5-10 users)

**Public Store Launch**: 6-10 weeks (legal review, scholar review, production setup, store submission)

---

## Next Recommended Actions (Priority Order)

1. **Legal review** - Finalize and publish ToS/Privacy Policy
2. **Crisis verification** - Complete evidence log for all resources
3. **Production hosting** - Deploy backend, configure monitoring
4. **Store assets** - Create screenshots, set up console accounts
5. **Scholar review** - Submit Islamic content for theological validation

---

## Risk Assessment

**High risks**:
- Legal non-compliance (store rejection)
- Unverified crisis resources (user safety)
- No production monitoring (blind to issues)

**Medium risks**:
- Data retention gap (privacy compliance)
- Billing policy mismatch (Stripe vs IAP)

**Low risks**:
- Performance optimization
- Feature completeness
