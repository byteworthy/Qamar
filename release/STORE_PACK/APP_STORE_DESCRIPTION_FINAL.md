## Full Description

**Noor**

AI-powered journaling for clarity and self-reflection

Noor is a private journaling and reflection app designed to help you slow down, organize your thoughts, and gain perspective using guided prompts and AI-generated reflections.

This app is built for everyday mental clarity, not therapy.

### What Noor helps you do

• Write freely in a calm, focused space
• Reflect on thoughts using structured prompts
• See your ideas reframed in a clearer, more grounded way
• Build a consistent journaling habit without pressure

Noor responds to what you write with reflective language meant to help you think, not tell you what to do.

### How it works

You write
Noor reflects
You decide what matters

Your entries are processed by AI to generate personalized reflective responses. This processing is essential to how the app functions.

If you are experiencing a mental health emergency, contact local emergency services.

### Privacy first by design

• No ads
• No data selling
• No tracking across apps
• Your writing stays private

You can request deletion of your data at any time.

### Who Noor is for

• People who journal
• People who overthink
• People who want clarity without labels
• People who want a calm, private space to reflect
