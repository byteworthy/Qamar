# Play Store Metadata (Android)

## Short Description
Islamic CBT reflections with calm, grounded guidance.

## Full Description
Noor CBT is an AI-assisted Islamic CBT companion designed to help Muslims work through difficult thoughts using evidence-based CBT techniques grounded in Islamic values. The app guides a short reflection flow that helps you capture a thought, identify patterns, reframe with care, and end with a grounding intention.

What you can do:
- Guided reflection flow (capture → reflect → examine → reframe → regulate → intend)
- Islamic framing woven into language and prompts
- High-distress pacing and crisis resource redirection
- Calming practices with short, structured steps
- Contextual duas based on inner state and life context
- Clear boundaries: not therapy, not a religious authority, not a crisis service
