Islamic CBT companion for mindful reflection

## Description
Noor CBT is an AI-assisted Islamic CBT companion designed to help Muslims work through difficult thoughts with evidence-based cognitive behavioral techniques grounded in Islamic values. The app guides a short reflection flow that helps users capture a thought, identify patterns, reframe with care, and end with a grounding intention.

Key highlights:
- Guided CBT reflection flow (capture → reflect → examine → reframe → regulate → intend)
- Islamic grounding woven into language and reflection prompts
- Gentle tone with high-distress pacing and crisis resource redirection
- Calming practices with short, structured steps
- Contextual duas based on inner state and life context
- Clear boundaries: not therapy, not a religious authority, not a crisis service
