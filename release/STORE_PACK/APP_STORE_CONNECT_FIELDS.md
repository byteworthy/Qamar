Noor

AI-powered journaling for clarity and self-reflection

Noor is a private journaling and reflection app designed to help you slow down, organize your thoughts, and gain perspective using guided prompts and AI-generated reflections.

This app is built for everyday mental clarity, not therapy.

What Noor helps you do

• Write freely in a calm, focused space
• Reflect on thoughts using structured prompts
• See your ideas reframed in a clearer, more grounded way
• Build a consistent journaling habit without pressure

Noor responds to what you write with reflective language meant to help you think, not tell you what to do.

How it works

You write
Noor reflects
You decide what matters

Your entries are processed by AI to generate personalized reflective responses. This processing is essential to how the app functions.

What Noor is not

• Not therapy
• Not medical advice
• Not a crisis or emergency tool

If you are experiencing a personal emergency, contact local emergency services.

Privacy first by design

• No ads
• No data selling
• No tracking across apps
• Your writing stays private

You can request deletion of your data at any time.

Who Noor is for

• People who journal
• People who overthink
• People who want clarity without labels
• People who want a calm, private space to reflect

AI transparency

Noor uses artificial intelligence to generate reflective responses. AI-generated content may occasionally be inaccurate or incomplete. Use your own judgment when reading any response.

## M. Export Compliance

**Likely Answer:** `Yes - Uses encryption, but qualifies for exemption`

**Reasoning:**
- App uses HTTPS for API communication (standard TLS encryption)
- No custom encryption algorithms
- Uses standard iOS/OS encryption (qualifies for ECCN 5D992 exemption)
- Typical journaling apps using HTTPS qualify for the encryption exemption

**Recommended answer in App Store Connect:**
- "Does your app use encryption?" → Yes
- "Does your app qualify for exemption?" → Yes (standard HTTPS/TLS)
- "Is your app available outside the US?" → Yes
- Export compliance documentation → Not required for HTTPS exemption

**Action Required:** Confirm with legal/compliance that HTTPS-only qualifies for exemption before answering definitively.
