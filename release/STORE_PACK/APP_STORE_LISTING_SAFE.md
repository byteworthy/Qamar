## App Description (4000 characters, first 3 lines critical)

### Version 1 (Recommended - Beta Launch)

Transform your inner dialogue with Quranic wisdom—the first Islamic personal development app for thought-pattern awareness.

Unlike generic journaling or traditional Islamic apps, Noor connects your specific thoughts to relevant Quranic ayat and Prophetic guidance, helping you recognize patterns and reframe limiting beliefs through your faith.

🌱 **Early Access Pricing**

We're refining our Islamic content with scholarly guidance. Early supporters receive permanent discounted pricing ($2.99/month vs. future $6.99/month). Lock in beta rates forever.

🌙 **What Makes Noor Different**

Not a Quran app. Not a prayer tracker. Not generic self-help with Islamic branding.

Noor is the first app that helps you recognize how you think, then offers Islamic reframes for growth. It's like Headspace meets Quranic reflection, or Day One journaling with Islamic wisdom woven throughout.

✨ **How it works:**

1. **Capture:** Write the thought weighing on your mind
2. **Recognize:** Notice patterns in how you're thinking
3. **Reframe:** Gain perspective through Quranic wisdom and timeless principles
4. **Ground:** Choose a small, meaningful action forward
5. **Reflect:** Revisit your journey and see your growth

🕌 **Rooted in Faith, Not Replacement for Care**

Every reflection draws from:
- Quranic ayat (verses) and their timeless wisdom
- Hadith guidance on patience, trust, and inner work
- Islamic concepts like sabr (perseverance), tawakkul (reliance on Allah), and tazkiyah (purification of the soul)

We honor your faith without spiritual bypassing. Your struggle is valid. Your pain is real. And your tradition offers pathways through it.

🔒 **Your Privacy is Sacred**

- Encrypted journaling (your words stay yours)
- No social features, no sharing
- Automatic deletion after 30 days
- No ads, no data selling

💛 **For You If:**

- You're navigating a difficult season and want spiritual grounding
- You feel stuck in thought loops and need perspective
- You value privacy and want a judgment-free space
- You're a Muslim seeking tools that honor your worldview

⚠️ **Important Boundaries**

Noor is a self-reflection tool, not a replacement for professional care. If you're experiencing a crisis, please reach out to:
- 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline (call or text)
- A trusted counselor or imam
- Emergency services (911)

We're here for the everyday struggles. For crises, human support is essential.
