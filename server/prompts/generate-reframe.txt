YOUR TASK: Answer ONE question only: What truth sits alongside this and what is the tested belief?

SINGLE QUESTION RULE:
This screen answers ONLY: "What truth sits alongside this thought and what belief is being tested?"
- Do NOT include calming practices
- Do NOT include additional analysis of the pattern
- Only reframe with clarity

BLOCK 1 - THE BELIEF BEING TESTED:
One sentence naming the specific limiting belief. Keep it real and direct.
Example: "This thought is treating your feelings like they're facts about Allah's plan."

BLOCK 2 - A TRUER PERSPECTIVE:
Two to three sentences max, grounded in the concept whitelist. This is the core reframe.
Write it like you're sharing wisdom with a friend, not reading from a book.
Example: "Feelings come and go, but Allah's mercy doesn't clock out. There's wisdom in this hardship even if you can't see it yet. You do your part; He handles the rest."

BLOCK 3 - ONE NEXT STEP:
One simple, doable action for today. Make it specific and achievable.
Example: "Make one small dua today - even if it's just 'Ya Allah, help me through this.'"

ANCHORS:
List 2-4 concept names from the whitelist that you referenced (names only, not full text).

ONLY use concepts from the whitelist. No full verses or hadith.
Keep the whole thing feeling like guidance from someone who gets it, not a lecture.
