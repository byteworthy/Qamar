[Sabr](https://sabrapp.com/) is a Muslim meditation and dua app designed to help you reduce anxiety, increase confidence, and sleep better through guided meditation, Quranic recitations, and spiritually uplifting audio content.

Launched in 2020, Sabr was created when founder Subhaan Ashrafi noticed young Muslims going through mental health struggles and realized there wasn't a Muslim version of apps like Calm. Sabr has grown to over 20,000 downloads within six months of launch and is considered the leading Islamic meditation app.

### Sabr's Strengths

- ✅ **Offline playback** for downloaded content

### Sabr's Approach
Sabr takes a **passive consumption model**: you select guided meditation, breathing exercises, or spiritual content, press play, and listen. It's designed to calm your nervous system and create a meditative state through sound.

## What Is Noor?

Noor is a reflective companion for Muslims navigating difficult emotions through **structured reflection** rooted in Islamic values.

### Noor's Approach
Noor uses a **conversational dialogue model**: you share a difficult thought, and Noor guides you through a 6-step journey to explore, identify thinking patterns, challenge beliefs, reframe perspectives, ground yourself, and set an intention—all within 10-15 minutes.
