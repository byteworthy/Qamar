# SEO Meta Descriptions & Metadata Guide

**Last Updated**: 2026-01-25
**Purpose**: Comprehensive metadata for all Noor competitor comparison pages

---

## Meta Description Best Practices

### Guidelines
- **Length**: 150-160 characters (Google displays ~155-160)
- **Include target keyword**: First 120 characters
- **Call-to-action**: "Compare", "Learn", "Discover", "See how"
- **Benefit-focused**: What user gains from clicking
- **Unique**: No duplicate descriptions across pages
- **Natural language**: Avoid keyword stuffing

### Formula
```
[Hook] + [Differentiation] + [Benefit] + [CTA]
```

**Example**:
"Sabr offers meditation; Noor offers cognitive work. See which Islamic mental health app fits your needs. Compare features, pricing, and approaches."
